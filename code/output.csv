7,Post,18d2kkv,"Final Update: What happened after YOLOing my life savings.Appreciate everyone here who was rooting for me. It‚Äôs certainly been a wild ride. For those new here, I YOLOd my life savings of 38k into META calls on Tuesday that expire this Friday. I ended up selling my META calls yesterday for a 10k loss, then like a true regard YOLOd the rest into üïπÔ∏èüõë options that became near worthless overnight.  I currently have only 5k left from the original 38k. To make things worse, I woke up from my sleepless night to see that META rocketed this morning and if I had just held one more day I would‚Äôve been up to 140k at today‚Äôs peak.

After that crazy YOLO went as bad as it possibly could, I want to reiterate that I‚Äôll be alright financially - yes I lost like 90% of my life savings but I have no debt and some money in my checking account to live on while I‚Äôm working part-time and even a bit to cover any emergencies. I am only 20 years old and I still got time to set myself up financially (because of my ACT score I got a full ride to a private University so I don‚Äôt have any student loans. And yes, just because I‚Äôm academically smart doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm financially smart as you all can see üòÜ).

I‚Äôve always considered myself a workaholic and I almost never spend any money on things that I don‚Äôt need, so I amassed that money doing various jobs like fast food, food delivery, and internships whenever I had free time throughout my teenage years (saying this because some people were assuming this was my parents‚Äô money). It‚Äôs time to save up again and move on past this loss. I‚Äôm obviously not doing the greatest mentally but a few people have reached out which I really appreciate and I know it‚Äôll get better. Also, I think it‚Äôs important to note that I YOLOd the money with the mentally to take full responsibility and accept the loss no matter how severe. I‚Äôve always wanted to do something crazy and illogical and decided to just go for it. We only get one shot at life, why not do something insane? When I‚Äôm 80 I know I‚Äôll look back at this thinking of how much of an idiot I was but at the same time kind of glad that I wanted to do something so insane and had the balls to just go for it. You only live once, right? I hope this makes people feel better about their losses, and serves as a warning to those considering doing something as stupid as I did. Long live feta, and FUCK META ‚úåÔ∏è

8,Post,18d1ifi,"Elon Musk goes off on Disney CEO Bob Iger, says he should be 'fired immediately'[https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-disney-ceo-bob-iger-comments-should-be-fired-2023-12](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-disney-ceo-bob-iger-comments-should-be-fired-2023-12)

&#x200B;

Elon Musk isn't letting up in his beef with Disney CEO Bob Iger.

The X boss trashed Iger on Thursday, [writing on X](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1732786907971539235) (formerly Twitter) that he should be ""fired immediately"" and that Walt Disney himself is ""turning in his grave over what Bob has done to his company.""

Musk pounced on news that New Mexico's attorney general had [sued Meta](https://www.nmag.gov/attorney-general-raul-torrez-files-lawsuit-against-meta-platforms-and-mark-zuckerberg-to-protect-children-from-sexual-abuse-and-human-trafficking/) and its CEO ‚Äî and longtime Musk rival ‚Äî Mark Zuckerberg.

The lawsuit alleges that Meta's social networks aren't doing enough to protect kids and that Instagram and Facebook were ""not safe spaces for children but rather prime locations for predators to trade child pornography and solicit minors for sex,"" according to AG Ra√∫l Torrez.

One user on X pointed out that Disney was still advertising on Meta; the company recently [pulled ads from X](https://www.businessinsider.com/disney-companies-drop-ads-x-twitter-antisemitism-elon-musk-2023-11) after Musk supported an [antisemitic post](https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-asana-cofounder-elon-musk-should-resign-endorsing-antisemitic-tweet-2023-11).

Musk [chimed in](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1732773421610606801) (misspelling the Disney CEO's name): ""Bob Eiger thinks it's cool to advertise next to child exploitation material. Real stand up guy.""

When another user asked why Iger hadn't been fired yet, Musk replied: ""He should be fired immediately.""

He also responded to a news headline about his call for Iger's firing with one word: ""truth.""

Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment ahead of publication.

It's Musk's latest attack on an advertiser who fled his platform. At the New York Times' Dealbook summit, Musk had a succinct and vulgar response to companies that didn't want to give him money anymore: [""Go fuck yourself.""](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-tells-advertises-get-lost-twitter-dealbook-summit2023-11)

At the event, Musk took the opportunity to single Iger out.

""Is that clear?"" Musk asked. ""I hope it is. Hey, Bob.""

Earlier at the summit, the Disney CEO was asked about his company's decision to pull advertising on X.

""We know Elon is larger than life in many respects, and that his name is very much tied to the companies he either has founded or he owns, whether it's [Tesla](https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla) or SpaceX or now X,"" Iger said.

Iger appeared to reference Musk's decision to boost an antisemitic tweet last month.

""By him taking the position that he took in quite a public manner, we just felt that the association with that position and Elon Musk and X was not necessarily a positive one for us,"" Iger said.

Musk faced an [onslaught of criticism](https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-asana-cofounder-elon-musk-should-resign-endorsing-antisemitic-tweet-2023-11) over his post on X which called an antisemitic post the ""absolute truth."" Though, Musk later appeared to walk back his original comment, calling it ""foolish.""

Iger and Disney are one of many that Musk has taken aim at over the years. The billionaire has publicly dissed several major figures and companies, including [Apple ](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-twitter-war-with-apple-history-of-criticism-2022-11)and [President Joe Biden.](https://www.businessinsider.com/joe-biden-elon-musk-feud-tesla-union-republican-06-2022)",2023-12-07,2

To make everything better he then proceeded to buy with the remaining money 218 contracts of 15.50 calls of the company that shouldn‚Äôt be named, only to lose 60% today (at the time of this post) on those same contracts.

Edit:
Because some tankie is offended in the comments that I dare offend the great chinese state with my personal opinion I will lay out why I personally think that here.


Here is my CHINA IS FUCKED thread...

Their population is rapidly aging, decreasing rapidly and still suffers from the gender imbalance.

On top of thatt, they just admitted that they overcounted their population by 100 million people.

Goodbye consumption-based growth.

Its GDP is vastly overstated. If you think it really is as big as they claim, ask yourself why you believe statistics from a known liar autocracy?

Independent researchers claim it is overstated by as much as 60%. If their research is off by half, it's still 30% overstated! ü§Ø

Their massive government debt is hidden among provinces and corporations. Remember that in ü§°üá®üá≥, all private corporations are ultimately owned by the state.

The government itself has no idea how much debt they have.

As if that debt load is not enough, their signature Belt and Road Initiative is turning out to be a financial debacle, with most countries not being able to pay back the debt. So they will have to write that off eventually. There is just no way around it.

Their unemployment among college graduates is a staggering 25%. So high that the government announced in July that they will no longer publish this statistic. Way to go ü§°üá®üá≥

And now comes the craziest part of it all....

A newly published report states that ü§°üá®üá≥ has built so much housing that it currently can house 2 billion people. That's TWICE their population!! ü§Ø

Who is going to purchase that? No one. And remember, their population is shrinking anyways. Their massive debt-financed investment in their housing is going to sink entirely.

30% of China's fake GDP is because of their property sector. 30%! And they have >100% real estate capacity!!

To put that into comparison, 16% of USA GDP is based on real estate. US financial crisis was caused when it had 5% over-capacity.

So China is more than twice ad dependent on real estate and has 20x bigger bubble than we had when our economy melted down

34 of China's 50 biggest property developers are now in default. Data on hundreds more smaller developers is not available

That doesnt include the largest of China's property developer, Everglades, which is about to go into default due to its $341B debt that it can no longer pay back.

Chinese people are no longer buying property. Because they often paid 100% down on apartments that can not be built because there is no money.

It's estimated that over 60 million people paid 100% down on properties that will never be built and their money can't be returned because the developers spent it on unfinished ghost cities.

I've been to many ghost cities in China. Its a sight to behold. Completely unfinished cities that will eventually be taken back by nature.

The largest pyramid scheme in the history of the world is now collapsing in ü§°üá®üá≥ and there is nothing their government can do about it

And it gets better...

And since Covid as well as consistent Chinese belligerence, there is a mass rush of western companies diversifying production to India, Philippines, Mexico and Vietnam because China is too risky.

Remember Japan's incredible growth post WW2 that ended up with 35 consecutive years of zero GDP growth? China is going to be like that but on the wildest steroids imaginable.

China is going to suffer from a multi-generational economic debacle.

When they told you they handled Covid better than anyone else? They lied. There are untold millions of people in China who are now dying from it but they hide the statistics

Never-ending that they gifted us Covid, Swine flu and Bird flu in the first place. I'll blame them for ebola just to top it off

""The Chinese Century"" my ass.

More like tHe cH·ªãN√®S√© cƒînt≈∞r√ÆE



China is more than twice as dependent on real estate and has 20x bigger bubble than USA had when our economy melted down.

Tens of millions of people, if not more, are going to lose their life savings and the government doesn't have enough money to bail them out

when the Chinese people get restless with their leadership, the leadership as they already started doing, will fan nationalism in order to redirect the anger of the people away from them. They are grabbing land (sea areas) and WILL stir up shit everywhere

And more Chinese belligerence towards USA, Philippines and Vietnam and Japan

But that only buys them limited time. People will only overlook their lost life savings for a short while

ü§°üá®üá≥ will have to choose whether to help it's people or continue to build its military or prop up its economy.

The thing is, it will be in such a massive debt burden that it won't be able to do any of it

Like I said, ü§°üá®üá≥ is FUCKED.

Fucked for generations. They've peaked as a superpower before they ever became anything more than just a widely hated regional hegemon.

92,Post,17v4k8w,"HOW BROKE ARE YOU?The cost of buying a typical home in the United States has risen to a new high, now requiring an annual salary of $114,627, a 15% increase from the previous year and more than 50% more than the $75,000 required in 2020.

This unaffordability is primarily attributed to soaring housing prices and increased mortgage rates, which pushed monthly mortgage payments to an all-time high of $2,866 in August, reflecting a 20% increase compared to the previous year.

The combination of the Federal Reserve's interest rate adjustments and limited housing availability has exacerbated the persistent challenges faced by potential homebuyers, particularly first-time purchasers.",2023-11-14,22
