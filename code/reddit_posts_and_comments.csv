0,Post,18buod3,Crying in the pharmacyI‚Äôm a new grad pharmacist since August. I‚Äôm currently a floater and yesterday I cried at the store I was at because a customer kept berating me bc I wouldn‚Äôt fill her control and she kept calling the line. I also had a rough couple of days prior with no show techs. I‚Äôm coming back to this store in a couple of weeks and I think the new techs and old techs think I‚Äôm weak for doing that. Has anyone else ever cried at work? Does it make me seem like a bad pharmacist?,2023-12-06,0

2,Comment,kc6qqtt,"One day I was working alone (like I used to every day, all day, 12 hours straight, no techs, just me) and I was working my butt off. I was juggling drop off, pick up, drive thru, typing, filling, putting order away, answering 6 line phone, etc, etc. This customer would just not stop berating me. She had an insurance issue, so I was stuck. I had vaccines to give, phones ringing, line at drop off and pick up and drive thru, hundreds of rxs to type, fill, check, consults waiting, and more, and I had been going for 9 hours, no breaks, no food, no restroom break, and I just lost it. I started crying right in front of that customer. I could not control it any longer. Frustration and exhaustion all just came to a head. I told her I would be right back. I went into the restroom, finally got my restroom break, cried a good 3 minutes, then went back out to continue the barrage. The customer was gone. I moved on and kept hopping from station to station. About 10 minutes later, the same customer was walking back to the pharmacy, this time with the store manager. I thought, ok, here we go. She proceeded to apologize, tell me she will call her insurance, told me I am doing a good job, and told the manager we need more staff in the pharmacy and that this is ridiculous. She became a long time customer and was one of my favorite customers going forward. We never did get more staff.",2023-12-06,0
3,Comment,kc6sbd0,"I cried at work. I‚Äôm front of a ton of people. Was a rough day. This patient who is always upset at the pharmacy, it‚Äôs always a problem for them. no matter what we did, it was wrong. There were a few times that things happened and it was genuinely frustrating for them which I completely understand but not much we could have done to prevent it or fix it. Just a lot of unfortunate circumstances and of course on my worst day this person showed up and started yelling while I was digging through 30+ warehouse totes looking for THEIR drug. I finally had enough of them berating me while I was elbow deep in drugs FOR THEM. I lost track of how many times I told them ‚ÄúI understand you‚Äôre upset I‚Äôm doing the best I can to help you can you give me a minute to try and resolve this?‚Äù And while they continued to berate me for how terrible this pharmacy was, I took the tote I was digging through, dropped it on the floor and announced to my techs and anyone in earshot that I needed to step out or I was going to say something to someone that I would regret. Was already crying at that point, walked right past that patient (who hadn‚Äôt stopped yelling at me either) straight into the break room and cried. Caught my breath, calmed down, came back, patient had chilled out a bit too and they tried to apologize for making me cry. I told them no, I don‚Äôt want to hear their fake apology. They were rude to me on more than one occasion despite the pharmacy doing far more than we should have to try and help them. They weren‚Äôt sorry for how they acted, never were. They were the kind of people who were proud of how they acted. they were sorry they got an outcome they didn‚Äôt expect (the outcome they expect being to fix all of their problems üôÑ) and so I told them I don‚Äôt want their fake apology and I would do what I could for them right then and they can leave and find another pharmacy because I won‚Äôt be filling for them in the future. Never saw them again. They were a headache and a half so that breakdown ended up helping me in the long run but it still sucked.

All that to say, we‚Äôve all been there. I think everyone cries in the pharmacy at some point. Some people just do it more gracefully than others.",2023-12-06,0
4,Post,186zhbl,"Finally told off KarenPatient of a certain age, let‚Äôs call her Karen. She was rx ator 40 and metf 500 as a new patient from a local and well respected PCP MD. 
She called to inform me that she would not be taking either med as her anemia is what is causing her a1c issue and her PPI was not allowing absorption of the free Fe.

I was at first trying to help by explaining that the two may be connected a a small amount but that‚Äôs not the main issue here‚Ä¶

She cut me off saying she had done her research online and would not be taking the meds.

I was done that at point.

I re-interrupted her. I said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry ma‚Äôam you are allowed to make your own medical decisions. But your research doesn‚Äôt replace the 12 years your MD or the 10 (MS aside) I did of school. I‚Äôll profile your meds. Have a great day!

12,Post,18075fn,"I hate being a pharmacistI'm so done working at a pharmacy as a pharmacist. I've realized lately that this field is not for me AT ALL. I honestly can't bear this anymore. Just today I was working alone the last hour before closing, and all of sudden I had a bunch of customers coming in the last 10-15 min to get their medications. I told them clearly we're closing soon, and that I would not be able to help them all in time. This especially since I was working alone. But I told them they could come back tomorrow. Or if it was urgent, that there were other open pharmacies nearby. Tell me why these people started arguing with me, and basically denied to leave. Even when I tried to reason with them. I then tried my best to hurry, but realized it was impossible for me to finish in time. And basically I would be working overtime. So I called my boss who agreed I should tell the remaining customers to leave. Some left eventually (angry ofc), but there was a stubborn couple (man and woman) who didn't want to leave. This couple seemed personally offended by me asking them to leave, and started being rude to me. I eventually decided to help them ( not that they deserved it), as I didn't want to waste more time arguing with them. However as I was getting the prescriptions ready, the man keeps talking disrespectfully to me. Saying things like ""Why are u so arrogant?"", ""You need to find another job"", ""What's the big deal about working overtime?"" ""I'm going to talk to your boss tomorrow and tell them what a terrible employee you are"", ""You need to learn customer service"" and so on. Mind you I was nothing but polite and professional talking to these customers. While he was saying these things I didn't say much back, as I didn't want things to escalate. Lastly I handed them the medications, and closed the pharmacy at overtime. 

But fr, what is this nonsense behavior from adults? These kind of things happen so often, it's getting really tiring. Like common if your medications were really that important, then you wouldn't show up the last 10 min before closing. I'm sick and tired of adults throwing ""tantrums"" because of their lack of time management. All those years in university to deal with this stupidity??? Another thing I hate is how understaffed most pharmacies are. How does it even make sense for me to close alone like this? I've told my boss I prefer to work with someone else, but I'm made to feel like I'm asking too much.  So I'm at a point rn were I just want to get out.

Anyone else with similar feelings? Also any advice on potential new career paths?",2023-11-21,1
13,Comment,ka48hf0,"The real problem was that you actually caved in and helped those people that refused to leave. You validated their bad behavior.

14,Comment,ka454wi,"I hear you. We see people like this often in our field.

People who need things last minute, only have one pill left, and it's five minutes before close, and they're leaving town before the pharmacy opens tomorrow morning, and it's a control, and there's no pharmacy at their destination, and their doctor's on vacation...

Sounds like they did absolutely no planning and it wasn't a big priority. Not my fault, not my problem. I have no sympathy. And I will tell them, and go home, and forget about it.

51,Post,17owhxa,"Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT WORK FOR CVSWorking for CVS has been an incredibly disheartening experience, one that I feel compelled to share as a cautionary tale. During my time at CVS, I dedicated several years to the company, consistently going above and beyond my role in both the front store and the pharmacy. What stands out most is the lack of regard for employee safety, particularly in a city where late-night hours often bring unforeseen challenges. For instance, I vividly recall instances when only two employees, usually young girls, were scheduled for closing shifts in a potentially risky environment. The situation during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic was equally concerning. I was compelled to assist in the pharmacy when pharmacy techs were unavailable due to customer frustrations. Despite my dedication, when I requested vacation two months in advance, my manager not only denied it but also refused to acknowledge his role in the denial, despite confirmation from HR. I consistently went the extra mile, covering for colleagues, and stepping in when needed. Yet, it became evident that CVS prioritized profits over the well-being of its employees. My second experience with the company, at a different location, further underscored this troubling trend. The manager exhibited a lack of compassion, urging an elderly colleague with vision problems to work faster, despite her challenges. Additionally, safety concerns arose when heavy totes precariously placed on high pallets posed a threat. Also, I heard that whatever they save from cutting hours will be a bonus for those people who work in corporate. PLEASE RECONSIDER WORKING FOR A COMPANY WHO DOESN'T CARE FOR YOU",2023-11-06,3

Boot up PCs. Grab money drawer. File prescriptions from last Friday. 

Open with customers looking pissed I've interrupted their Saturday. Check one patient out in minute and a half. 

Other patient walks up. Phone rings, put phone on hold. Finish ringing up second patient. Answer phone to process refill that could easily be done via app or phone on the patients end, 3rd patient walks up to the counter while on the phone. 

Help them. Rinse repeat until an hour after open and my 3 separate vaccine appointments show up, 2 of whom are getting multiple vaccines. 

Process their shots, prepare and mix shots. Phone rings, customer walks up to counter. Help customer thinking might as well let vaccines warm up a bit to make them more comfortable??

Quick break to give shots, phone rings, ignores phone. Runs to give shots. Same phone number rings after what must have been several attempts on the last 20 minutes. Answers phone, ""no we don't have Adderall 20mg here sorry, no I can't look it up, no I don't have 10mg or 30mg to offer either sorry"". Family walks up to counter.

Family has 2 young kids, all want flu and covid shots. I told them the day prior via phone I'd be by myself and it wasn't going to be very smooth. They didn't care, kids can't get into pediatrician... process their shots, older boy spends 30 minutes crying and bitching, I'm so emotionally drained I just sit there and watch mom and boy argue. Eventually gives shot, goes back into pharmacy to see a long line of angry people. Several voice-mails on the phones. 

By the end of the day I filled MAYBE 15 prescriptions that were not waiters or narcotics. Thank fuck I'm a slow store and was able to catch up on Sunday as everyone is either hungover, watching football, or Church...

My mom says everyone hates their jobs and nobody likes to work. Is this fucking normal though? Like it's at this point that is comically bad. I work for a grocery chain at a slow store and hate every minute of it.

The doctor wanted the nurse to send refills for the patient‚Äôs duloxetine. The patient has been on 40mg for over a year, however this nurse sent a refill for 60mg. The patient confirmed that the doctor did not mention a dose change, and it was very certain it was a mistake.

When called to ask, she said ‚ÄúHow would the pharmacy know? Doctor X has been sending this 60mg dose and the pharmacy should just fill it as is. You don‚Äôt know anything‚Äù. 

So I told her there has been regular 40mg scripts send from Dr. X for over a year now. She got defensive and said pharmacy just have made a mistake, there must have been a fraud of some kind (wow). And again repeated that pharmacists don‚Äôt know anything, so just go ahead and do what the doctor ordered. 

Turns out Dr.X has been calling in Cymbalta 40mg. And this nurse looked all the way back over a year ago to find a script written for Duloxetine. This nurse DOES NOT KNOW CYMBALTA AND DULOXETINE ARE THE SAME DRUG.

Agree with them. I mean go full throttle sarcastic agreement. Make sure to be totally straight faced while your doing it. 

‚Äú I know EXACTLY what you mean. When I started as a pharmacist we made $28 an hour and worked 10-12 hour shifts 6 days a week. No one complained. We were so thankful just to have a job!!! Sure, we were overwhelmingly busy and back then we weren‚Äôt entitled to lunch breaks anyway. There was no family leave or time off for a new baby or sick family member back then. Like back then, my boss called me in to work on the day my husband was on the surgical table undergoing cancer surgery. I had no choice then. I went and I did my job! Of course, I had to beg my neighbor to watch my kids on zero notice but thank the Lord for that, right?
We ate a BIG breakfast because we didn‚Äôt have time for lunch, much less 5 minutes to take a piss. Overtime was required and if you didn‚Äôt do it - well they would fire your ungrateful self. Did we complain? Heck No! 
We were GRATEFUL!! Grateful I tell you!! ‚Äú‚Äù

161,Post,16ufiub,"Results of the CVS WalkoutA statement from the organizers of the CVS KC walkouts:

September 27, 2023 will be the date to remember as the day Retail Pharmacy began its evolution to truly caring about the work environment for its pharmacists and technicians to provide SAFE and effective care for its patients.  The last 7 days have been grueling but also rewarding for the KC Pharmacists who started this movement to force change.  The team is proud of the results of its efforts. What did they accomplish locally in KC and nationwide for the retail drug industry?

1.  They took a stand and brought attention to the drastic improvements that are needed in this industry.  Not everything can be fixed in 7 days.  The Retail Giants now understand that the Pharmacy Teams are done with the old environments and have an expectation of their employer to provide environmental standards that promote safe patient care.

2.   The new Leader of the KC region was introduced to the team today.  On his first day, he has already started the healing process and is creating a positive culture free of retaliation and punitive threats.

3.  Approved extra Technicians and Pharmacist hours to meet the needs of the business until market stabilization.

4.  Pharmacists will now be paid for extra time worked at their stores  (come in early or stay late).  

5.  Laptops will be deployed to allow Pharmacists to assist pressured stores virtually to help prevent backlog and allow for better care for their patients

6.  Vaccinations reduced to a manageable volume.

7.   Cleanup teams from outside the market will be deployed to help stores that are extremely behind and prevent rollover.

8.  Outside organizations hired to help the market hire qualified Pharmacists and Technicians to fill staffing needs.

9..  Walgreens, the 2nd largest retail giant, is now inspired to force change for their pharmacy teams as well.  The country will be watching October 9-11.  The Pharmacists in KC fully support those Walgreens Pharmacists and are proud of them for saying enough is enough!

ALL of this was accomplished by a group of heroes. The Pharmacists from the Kansas City Metro market stood toe to toe with a Fortune 4 company and together helped improve working conditions for Pharmacists to provide safe patient care.  Obviously, the work has just started and we look forward to the next wave of improvements throughout the country at CVS. We have a follow-up with the CVS executives on 10/13 and it will be up to us to hold them accountable. 

Thank you to all the Pharmacists, Technicians, and Interns who stood with us and supported us in our mission. Thank you to the local and national media who picked up our story and shared it with the masses. Thank you to all Pharmacy Associations who publicly supported our efforts to force change.  Thank you to all the Pharmacy Influencers including Bled Tanoe, Shane with The Accidental Pharmacist, and all of their followers who helped spread the message and recruit support for change.  Thank you to all of the people sending messages of inspiration and to the entire Pharmacy profession for ALL of the support.

Thank you to our patients for your support over the past 7 days.  We know it was not easy for you, but we appreciate your sacrifices and we can't wait to get back to our stores TOMORROW to thank you in person. Thank you to ALL of the Pharmacists in Kansas City for taking this stand and making such a positive impact on our profession. Finally, thank you to CVS Leadership for hearing us for the first time and implementing short-term plans to stabilize our market now, and implementing strategies to help promote the change that is needed to help your Pharmacy teams meet the daily demands.",2023-09-28,8

178,Comment,k2dzyyv,"Update:

****The update you have been waiting for****: The KS, MO and surrounding areas are still Walking out tomorrow, Wednesday September 27th! 

My sincere apologies for the late update. There have been negotiations between the organizers of the Walkout and  very high executives of CVS Health . At the end of meeting, demands were made and agreement was achieved. Two sets of  demands were made with specific timelines to be accomplished.

It was understood that an accord was made which would have ultimately resulted at a postponing( NOT cancelling)  of the Walkout until everyone could come back together at the table to create actionable steps which will better working conditions and allow patients to have access to safe and optimal care.

However, it looks like this was simply an attempt from CVS Health to waste time so that the word will not get out on time to inform everyone that the KS and MO areas Walkout was still happening.

This is such a disappointment and ultimately it speaks volume of the character and the values of this company and its leaders.

A public statement from CVS Health  has been issued to the media which will go out tomorrow! But it does not speak about anything that was said during that meeting.

The KS, MO and surrounding areas are still Walking out tomorrow.

This is the latest update I have.

As a profession, I invite all of us to support them in any we can. Please remember that myself or the organizers out of KS , MO and other areas are NOT asking you to do this . While they appreciate your support, they are asking for unity whatever it looks like to you. Myself and they do not want to cause personal harm to you. But there are indeed strength in numbers. 

In honor of tomorrow, change your profile picture across social media to the picture on my advocacy pages or the various other graphics you have seen on social media. And west arm/ wrist band with color like blue, purple, yellow or black to stand in unity and solidarity. And share them on social media.

Lastly, speed the word as this message is so late out. Send this to news outlets. We have a lot of coverage coming out tomorrow!

We are strong together! And they have messed. with the wrong profession!",2023-09-27,8

200,Comment,k1p0w5l,"It's the gate from a cvs pharmacy in a target store. The gates have weighted spring that counterbalances them makes them open and close. Once the spring snaps the gate is useless. The target stores in my area are about 25 years old. We only have one pharmacy that still has the original pharmacy gate. When the spring snaps you can't raise or lower the gate. So if it happens when you are opening you just can't open the pharmacy for the day. But, when it happens at closing time the pharmacist has to stay at the pharmacy until an emergency company can come out. They have to manually open the gate with a metal emergency chain usually located in the ceiling and support it with 2 by 4's to hold it open. Then they have to build a temporary gate. This is usually a bunch of drywall and a random house door that they can purchase at the nearest hardware store. Since you can't see through the drywall you have no idea when someone is at the counter. We also had to move all the filled prescription bags inside the pharmacy because we couldn't not get behind the drywall to access them. Since the pharmacy is now owned by cvs the gate has to be replaced by them. Someone has to come out and measure for a new gate and it takes about a week to make a new gate and install it.",2023-09-22,8

So I wanted to share what happened to me today. Guy calls up, says he needs my help. This is exactly how the convo went. For context, he‚Äôs a Boomer aged white male:

‚ÄúHey man. So I take lorazepam, and did you know that‚Äôs a benzodiazepine? Anyway, I go to my doctor for my checkup. Go in for my appointment. I got real bad dry skin. So this colored nurse comes in. I tell her she has beautiful skin. Then I tell her I wish I had her skin. Because the thing is man, black women just really hold onto moisture well.

Anyway, so a couple weeks go by and then I get this letter saying the doctor fired me as a patient for being racist! So now I cAnT eVeN cOMpLiMeNt pEopLe! 

I had also missed my previous 3 appointments.

So I called a new doctor so I could get my benzo refilled with them. Got an appointment. Had to cancel the appointment because my step-mother-in-law died. Now my next appointment isn‚Äôt for 3 weeks. And they won‚Äôt refill my lorazepam! I know you went to school with my kids. Can you get me 3 weeks worth of lorazepam?‚Äù

Guys we aren‚Äôt even his pharmacy. He wanted to bring a bottle in, from another pharmacy, with a doctor‚Äôs name on it that fired him, to get 3 weeks of free controlled meds, because his racist ass can‚Äôt keep an appointment. I politely said no.

I just needed someone to ride that emotional rollercoaster with me.",2023-08-29,12

Workload is crushing, stress is killing you slowly, and burnout is the norm. Mental health and physical health issues from constant stress is met with further cuts, and higher expectations from the ruthless, out of touch leaders. Young grads, with huge amounts of debt from pharmacy school student loans, are quickly overwhelmed, and disillusioned by the mountain of unobtainable metrics. They are threatened with discipline daily, and are forced to cheat the system to stay off the radar of the corporate bullies. Action plans, coach and counsel, write-ups, punitive action for not reaching any one of the dozens of metrics causes morale and engagement to suffer greatly, leading to apathy and high turnover.

277,Comment,juylv7b,"I thought this a few months in. I actually was so excited to career climb at cvs. I took on a pic role far too early. I realized my district and regional managers were evil very quickly. It was january and the regional manager was asking me how we could get caught up on our prescriber request queue while we saw the pharmacy exploding around us with nonstop people coming in. He kept nitpicking things that don't matter. It was a 24 hour store with just two techs helping at a time due to their drastic schedule cuts, which is near impossible. Just absolutely no sense of what's important. They loved to play blame game with me. I remember the meeting that I realized it's a lose lose situation. I went home and cried like I had just gone through a terrible break up because it felt like all of my dreams were crushed. I had just spent almost a decade getting a pharmD so I could help people, and it felt like it was all for nothing. 

I realized there and then that I couldn't last more than 5 years. I would either get hurt physically (heart attack or something similar), lose it mentally and possibly ruin my career, or get shot since corporate didn't seem to care about protecting us from robberies. I was like it's only a matter of time before one of these outcomes happens. I applied for hundreds of jobs over the next two years with barely any success. Finally, I got a break exactly at my 3 year mark (which is what some consider residency equivalent). 

What I did NOT expect was the actual effect this job had on me AFTER I left. I think I am still struggling with some PTSD, even almost 2 years later. I shoved all my emotions under a rug for years. One time we were robbed at cvs and I remember not even being phased at all. Months after I left, somehow my emotions came back. I was crying at random movies all the time. Near the end of my stint with cvs, I was having about five panic attacks per day. Now I have one every few months and they become more rare. Just yesterday I was startled by a coworker and had some weird crying/panic reaction that was a very out of body experience for me. 

For all of you still in retail, I feel for you so much. I hope you all get out and I believe covid shifted the tide for us quite a bit. Remember to be kind and forgiving to yourselves. ‚ù§Ô∏è",2023-08-05,14

279,Comment,juxd4so,"Well said. I completely agree. 

I can see clear as day what pharmacy should be. It should be what people want, which is convenience and excellence.

What they get is a corporate meat-grinder of vaccine-pushing and front end sales with overworked staff who don‚Äôt get half of the resources they need. 

Despite all of the high-minded and wholesome marketing pharmacies have lost sight of their primary job of safely and efficiently fulfilling prescription orders. They aren‚Äôt customers. They‚Äôre patients. And yes, sometimes they‚Äôre grumpy and impatient, but if you‚Äôve ever tried simply communicating with people and establishing reasonable expectations you‚Äôll find that they‚Äôre much happier with the service.

Then went to PMP and they always pick up their Adderall a few cities over, 10-15 days early almost every time except recently, they've picked up 3-30 day supplies within a 20 day span.
Told the patient we would not be filling it because of that. They said they are traveling and left them at home, told them no still. They said they could have their doctor call us to release it, told them that would not change the outcome because we would not fill a C-2 outside of the doctors trade area.
Doctor calls us a bit later asking why we wouldn't fill it. We ask if they are aware that they pick them up early every month plus just received 3-30 day supplies within a 20 day span. They acted like that was pretty normal so then we asked when was the patients last in office visit... They replied that the patient has not been seen in office ever, they just wrote them scripts...
They then tell us they're going to call the board and file a complaint. So I finish inputing the 2 scripts just so we could put a blanket refusal on that prescriber.

Thank you! I know calling the pharmacist was another item added to your already stressed mental load, but thank you! One of the worst parts of pharmacy is rarely getting a conclusion to things. I mentioned this in another thread, but we don't often know what happens to people when they leave the pharmacy. Did our OTC recommendation work? Did the patient get better? What happened? Often, the answer is ""we don't know"".

I know this seems minor in the grand scheme of everything that just happened to you and your son, but thank you for giving that pharmacist closure.

360,Post,14ge34s,"Worst Decision of My LifeBecoming a clinical/hospital pharmacist 3 years ago is probably the worst thing I could have done for my mental health. 

Prior to going the clinical route I was relatively content. Then I transitioned to working as an ICU pharmacist. Dedicated weeks to becoming as proficient as possible in my field of expertise, and for a while I was happy. Then I got close to my physician colleagues and we started discussing salaries. 

I got a 4 year bachelor‚Äôs degree, plus my Pharm.D right before the advent of these new 6 year programs. Average hospital comp now is around $55/hr. Compare that to the average medical resident, who makes about half of that. Then when they become attendings, their salary balloons to easily 3x to 4X my salary‚Ä¶at the minimum for hospitalists. I have ophthalmologist friends pulling in $1-2M/year in private practice. 

But by far the worst part of being a hospital pharmacist is having the clearest view of the glass ceiling on our profession. I‚Äôve found that in healthcare, administrators stratify staff into 2 categories. You either are a money maker, or a cost. Physicians, PAs, NPs, CRNAs, and even nurses sometimes, are in the money maker category simply because they‚Äôre necessary for revenue generation. Pharmacists though are viewed as nothing more than a cost, expensive librarians and shopkeepers if you will, and costs get squeezed every chance they get. It‚Äôs why the pharmacist gets in trouble when the surgery Pyxis is empty, despite anesthesia grabbing 5 vials instead of the 1 they charted. It‚Äôs why ‚Äúdelaying patient care‚Äù slips so casually out of the nurse‚Äôs mouths when we ask them why they can‚Äôt find the full insulin vial I sent them yesterday. It‚Äôs why they leave one pharmacist overnight for an entire shift to ‚Äúmanage‚Äù. Then I look at nurses, physicians and other professions being able to work across the country with their compact licenses, while I just had to shell out $2,000 to reciprocate to to other states. 

When I worked in a 503b facility for a year, I was never so confronted by the fact that I could have gone to school for the same amount of time, spent about the same on tuition, worked and made middle class money for a few years as a resident, and then enjoyed wild financial freedom compared to what I make now. Now I sit here staring at the results of my relatively uninformed decisions and this totem pole that we sit on the bottom of as we cling to deserving the title of ‚Äúdoctors‚Äù of pharmacy. My friend who‚Äôs a software engineer with a few certificates makes more than I do, sitting on her ass working remotely from a cheap villa in Bali if she feels like it‚Ä¶despite having an associates degree and no student loans.

My job is so easy compared to the physicians, and I don't have a tenth the liability that they do. Comparing myself to nurses (who are really well-compensated at my hospital), I still feel good about my job. When a patient needs a 1 L lactulose enema every 4 hours it's not me putting in the rectal tube and draining it. It's not me on a rigorous schedule of managing all of the drips and meds for my patients. I'm not inserting IVs and PICCs and central lines, and documenting blood sugars every hour, and cleaning festering stumps. When there is a code, all I have to do is have some knowledge and prepare a few meds at the bedside. 

And despite all of this, I'm still the one that the teams asks for advice on medication issues. They turn to me for answers and help and knowledge and that feels good! Maybe you just need to find a different work environment because you make it sounds so bleak.",2023-06-22,19

They told everyone its because there is a shortage of pharmacists and they want to provide pharmacists better work life balance. Gullible managers in my district actually bought this excuse. 

Guys, there is neither a shortage nor does CVS want to provide better work life balance. 

The real reason they cut hours of operation is because they realized pharmacists are happy to work for free. They cut my store hours by 1 hr everyday. They know pharmacists come in 1 hr early and stay 1 hr late. Some even stay 3 hrs late!!!

So they realized they can get the same amnt of work out pharmacists for 5-8 hrs less of pay each week. 

THAT is the real reason. It bothers me when people stupidly fall for the ""shortage"" excuse. No. They are saving money.

Right now I am getting 32 hrs per week base salary....as a licensed professional. My partner asked if I want to come in 2 hrs early on my off day to put up truck together and get the pharmacy back in order. Hell no. Not with no 32 hrs paid per week as a licensed professional.

Just practice having the guts to not overextend yourself. Leave on time no matter what.  Ask yourself, ""what emotions do i feel that prevent me from leaving on time when my shift ends?""
If it isn't a positive emotion or feeling then you have a problem.

Whether or not there is too much work during the day is the company's problem.  They aren't giving y'all Enough coverage and overlap so that the CEO can have millions of dollars in bonuses and so the shareholders can enjoy millions of dollars in profits. 

That's why you give 150%.   The idea that you're doing it so that you don't leave the work for the people in the pharmacy is a lie.
You are working extra and working for free in the name of corporate profit.

479,Comment,jjuja4u,"In my 29th year of practice (2021), near the end of the year, the company I worked for was able to recruit a slew of newly licensed pharmacists from the local ~~diploma mill~~ brand new pharmacy school. One of them was hired to fill a long-open position as PIC, and accepted the job at $43/hour. I had been floating at that store, and after a few days orienting her to things, she pulled me aside. She told me she was very upset because she just incurred $250k of student debt and was told ""pharmacists around here start at $60+ and hour"". That was how I found out she was only making $43, and she asked me how much I was making and I told her, yes... I was hired on at $63/hr but now was up to $65/hr.


And that was when I saw the writing on the wall. If new grads were being locked into single location jobs at that rate, then those of us who were hired at the pinnacle of the labor shortage in this area were going to be on the chopping block. About a month later, I was summonsed upstairs to the manager's office, where a corporate HR person informed me my services were no longer needed. And then, she proceeded to tell me I was eligible for rehire, and offered me a new contract. The first thing I noticed was my hourly rate (had been $65/hr) was $53/hr. I asked her if that was a mistake, and she informed me that it was not, and they had definitely considered my experience with the company as well as 29 years of experience overall, and this was the new normal... get used to it (paraphrasing). 


I politely handed her back the contract and said ""Have a nice day"" and left. I picked up some shifts from a couple of local Indys to pay the bills, and eventually decided to take money out of savings to start a new business (not related to pharmacy) and get out of the pharmacy profession altogether.

If we want mods that actually work or have worked in a pharmacy that already heavily limits the pool of options. This as all volunteer, dealing with mostly dumb shit, so even when we do get someone to volunteer to help out they get burned out really fast and stop. I would LOVE to be able to have enough mod volunteers to be able to vote on new ones. That would be fantastic.  As it is we take almost anyone that offers.

I work retail. It's fine. My store has some NOTORIOUSLY special patients. One comes in today. I was typing up front, so I didn't help her, but I had the absolute PRIVILEGE of overhearing this entire interaction.

She says that her doctor gave her a sample of a new nose spray. She tried it for her decongestion, and the first bottle worked for one spray and the second didn't work at all. She thought that the spray mechanism was broken, so she wanted a refill. The clerk looked at it, got confused, so she asked for the verifying pharmacist to look at it. 

The pharmacist who was helping her, looks at it and says, how often are you using this? 

She says, once a day at most. 

Pharmacist looks at her for a moment and then tries to delicately say, this medication should be used as needed, at which point I'm thinking, Oh God don't tell me she's doing what I think she's doing. 

Spoiler, she is.

She says she could take it once a week instead. She says she just needs something for her decongestion.

The pharmacist says, ma'am this prescription isn't for decongestion, this is for opioid overdose. 

She was trying to use NARCAN, not only DAILY, but as a decongestant.

The doctor just handed her Narcan, didn't even send it to a pharmacy, and gave no explanations. Just, ""here's a nasal spray.""

They are recuperating 4.8mil from CVS for violating the law. CVS retaliated by kicking employees of large corporations who live in Oklahoma out of their 90 day mail order network, forcing them to fill 30 day RXs at a higher cost. CVS tried to blame Oklahoma law but the Oklahoma Insurance Commissioner put his foot down and said the law does not prohibit CVS from filling 90 day prescriptions, just that they cannot steer those prescriptions to pharmacies owned by their affiliated company. They are now considering removing CVS Caremark's PBM license to operate in Oklahoma.

With new state laws passing to reign in PBMs in nearly every state, and the FTC investigation into anti-competitive practices from PBMs, does anyone think we may see some kind of reform on the horizon?

Anyone else notice a huge decrease in the overall quality of newer grads? I swear some are borderline mentally deficient.

He wanted to call the prescriber and clarify directions, since the suspensions were only in 200, 250, and 400/5.

I told him no, just convert the dose to whatever we have available.

He couldn't do it. He couldn't convert 450 mg doses into a 400/5 mg bottle. This is a pharmacist, with a pharm. D.

What has this profession become? Look up NAPLEX passing rates now, they are lower than ever, in the low 80's now. Even my alma mater is in the mid 80's. My graduating year we were 100%. Year before, 99%, had one person fail first time. Year after I graduated they had 1 fail, 99% again.

They expanded class sizes by almost 50% since then, took any dumbass that would take on 300k of loans, and are pumping out pharmacists that frankly, are dangerous.

I routinely get pharmacists on the phone and try to work out some solution to a problem with a mutual patient, and they are just absolutely thunderstruck and clueless. It seems that the younger workers are just FAR less capable of any sort of problem solving. They can only do what they have been trained on a very narrow track. Very frustrating.

Staff: Hi, are you urgently needing your medication to be filled? We only have 1 staff and 2 calls out today, if it is urgent, I‚Äôd recommend having your doctor send us a new prescription, standard wait time for transferring prescription will take couple days considering we are short-staff for this week. 

Customer: No, I took my last Zolpidem today and I need it, do you want to see me not able to sleep and miss work tomorrow?

Staff: Since you‚Äôre requesting Zolpidem to be refilled, we can have the pharmacist try to call Costco sometime later this afternoon and expedite it for you, may I know if this is a refill or a brand new prescription? 

Customer: no, I need you guys to call NOW, Costco has been filling it for me for YEARS and they waited until I took my last pill today and told me they didn‚Äôt have it in stock. I want to be able to pick it up right away, else will you be responsible for me missing work tomorrow? 

Staff: *annoyed but as answer nicely as she could* I would let my pharmacist know you‚Äôre urgently needing the medication, we just need to know if it is a refill or brand new prescription because federal law doesn‚Äôt allow us transfer controlled substance like Zolpidem without it being filled the first time at Costco.

Customer: I already told you? Costco has been refilling my Zolpidem for years, you just said you don't have time to call Costco right away but you're wasting time repeating what I already told you. Just tell your pharmacist to call them right away and bill them under a couple card! 

Sorry and not sorry that you‚Äôre in a pickle because a pharmacy ran out of your meds, and you see the need to blame another pharm staff for your lack of planning?

580,Comment,je56rvx,"As a Paramedic I have mixed feelings about this - more positive than negative.

I am SUPER HAPPY basically anyone can start the opioid overdose reversal process and help save a life. However, I personally witness Police flooding an overdose victim with gallons of naloxone, and then you take someone breathing 3 times a minute, their end tidal CO2 is 85 mmHg, and O2 sat at 58% and basically wake them up.

Anyone here ever see someone like that immediately become conscious? Yes, sometimes we may have to sedate them again enough to ventilate them appropriately and blow off that CO2. Lay people are probably going to get punched, kicked, bit, or roughed up, but that's the roll of the dice you take in favor of saving someone's life.

In EMS, we titrate the naloxone to adequate breathing with or without assisted ventilation and then STOP. The *perfect* sedative is a partially reversed opioid overdose with them barely conscious and I can manage their airway and ventilation on my own terms. Smooooooth ride to the ER for everyone. That's not going to be the case for every adult. Sure, a toddler getting into a fentanyl patch and getting reversed is worth the tantrum afterwards, but what about a 6ft, 175 lb man? Some people are going to get hurt. 

Lastly, a lay person administering the nasal spray may get lucky and gently reverse the overdose, however we all know the terminal half life of naloxone. What happens when the victim says ""thanks dude"" and then walks off only 30 min later to go unconscious? Sometimes EMS and Police response times are >8-10 min.

I really would want to see EMS Medical Directors across the US hand down a directive that any overdose reversed by OTC naloxone is a 1 way ticket to the ER even if the patient refuses. It's the same way with IM glucagon in hypoglycemia where we can't get an IV. You get IM glucagon, you are coming with me.

EMS needs *crystal clear direction* in these cases, otherwise somewhere, sometime there's going to be a Youtube video of us dragging someone into the ambulance screaming about kidnapping.",2023-03-29,30

608,Comment,jd1ouda,"The only solution is a law requiring 51% ownership of any pharmacy by a licensed pharmacist as it is in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Germany, Italy and many many other countries. The pharmacies in the hands of pharmacists will also solve our reimbursement issue as there will not be some giant corporation willing to take negative reimbursements to drive out competition and with no alternative pbms will have to offer higher reimbursements and second it will solve the lobbying of these stupid laws as licensed pharmacists will not lobby their jobs away or be willing to cut corners in patient safety like these massive corporations. We are seeing the introduction of a sacrifice of patient safety by allowing staff not sufficiently trained for the role a problem not seen in any country where pharmacists own Atleast 51% of the pharmacy. Lastly, techs and assistants this is in your interests as well more money in the hands of pharmacists through ownership will mean better staffing and working conditions as with the owner being a pharmacist with their license on the line will make better decisions for pharmacists and employees. Additionally in North Dakota state where this is law patients have better access to pharmacies and enjoy lower drug costs this is better for patients as well. 

I assure the whole world that a pharmacist will run a pharmacy better than some MBA trying to please shareholders up in some corporate headquarters. Bring the pharmacy back under ownership of the pharmacist and all these problems will disappear. This is the real legislation we need but this doesn‚Äôt even get talked about. Our profession is going down the drain and the only thing we are doing is adding years of residency for roles that will soon be done more and more by techs.

If this was the case all along why did it go from b pharm to pharmd plus 2 years of residency to do a job that has been done for decades by a b pharm.",2023-03-21,31

It‚Äôs Wednesday, 1:26pm, 4 minutes until we close for lunch until 2pm. I‚Äôm helping a gentleman pick up his meds for multiple family members, thinking this is the last customer before lunch, I‚Äôll let anyone else know before we close the gate to come back in 30 minutes. At 1:28, there comes three people behind my current customer. I gently say, ‚Äúhey everyone, we‚Äôre actually closing in just two minutes for our scheduled lunch. We will be back at 2pm.‚Äù

This is where the fun starts. Patient 1 says they‚Äôve ‚Äúbeen waiting 10 minutes!‚Äù (This isn‚Äôt true, we‚Äôre a small pharmacy and the only person to walk up for their meds is my original customer at 1:26. I would have seen them). Patient 2 says ‚Äúthis is the second time you‚Äôve done this. I want to pick up my meds‚Äù.

For patient 1, why lie? You know good and well you did not show up 10 minutes ago because I would have served you first. And for the second, if this has happened before, surely you were told the previous time that we close from 1:30-2 for lunch, EVERY DAY. As my pharmacist and only coworker would have made you aware, if not for the multiple signs that have been posted for at least a year.

I told them, ‚ÄúI apologize but we are scheduled to close from 1:30-2 every day for lunch. We will be back in 30 minutes.‚Äù ‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúI want your corporate number and name.‚Äù Okay! I‚Äôll have that for you when I come back from my break.  üòå they didn‚Äôt come back.",2023-03-18,32

631,Comment,jcijfe9,"Internal or external hemorrhoid?  

It reminds me of time I got an external hemorrhoid. I tried to tell my football teammates that something was hanging out of my butt and it wasn‚Äôt shit. No one believed me. They said I was crazy. They said it was poop. They said I was just a nasty defensive lineman. I had to prove them wrong. 

So after practice I made sure I was one of the first people in the shower.  I finished first, so the majority of the team was still in the shower room. I positioned myself in the middle of the entrance/exit, pulled my butt cheeks apart, and screamed at the top of my lungs. AHHHHHHH. Naturally everyone looked toward the blood curdling scream.  People freaked out. They were scared. They screamed. No one, myself included knew what a hemorrhoid was. 

Then someone ran into the training room screaming ‚Äòwe need help in the locker room now‚Äô. All the trainers come running in. The coaches heard all the commotion, so they come running in. Now we have like 60 football players, 5 trainers (mostly female), and the whole coaching staff all looking at my anus. Everyone, except the head trainer, is screaming because no one knows what‚Äôs hanging out of my ass. My only emotion was vindication. Everyone saw with their own eyes that something was hanging out of my butt and it wasn‚Äôt shit. I was right and I proved it to the world, or my teammates, coaches, and training staff. 

At this point the head trainer, the only person who didn‚Äôt scream at sight, explained to me, and the football team what a external hemorrhoid was. He went on to explain that I would probably just shit it out after a few days. About a week later I took a shit that looked like 3 smashed tomatoes. I wish I could include the picture of the shit with this post but this was way before iPhones and the cloud. 

This is my hemorrhoid story. It is 100% truthful. The point is, no matter what comes out of your butt during undergrad you can still become a productive pharmacist who gets 30 minute lunch breaks. The other point is, if you have hemorrhoids you can wait 30 minutes to get cream or better yet you can just be man and shit it out with any medication.",2023-03-17,32

665,Post,11ecjuv,"Closing My Walgreens UpdateDecided to go with a 2 weeks notice per many professional opinions.

Posting my resignation letter below:

Please accept this letter as notice of my resignation from my position as Pharmacy Manager with Walgreens as of March 16, 2023.

I have appreciated my time here but have decided to put in my resignation for a variety of reasons. It is my opinion that Walgreens has a flawed system for calculating the number of hours and the staffing needed in order to care for our patients appropriately. I tried for 4+ months to receive assistance and in that time I did not receive the resources needed. I was also presented information about store metrics inappropriately by being told that our script count had decreased from the previous year when in fact it had not. It had been artificially inflated due to covid tests/shots being included. It also does not account for the controlled substance prescriptions filled at our store. This, in combination with my most recent meeting with our District Manager, who demanded that we complete patient portal calls after being told repeatedly that we did not have the staff to complete basic functions such as deletes and outdates, solidified my decision to resign. It's unfortunate that our leadership can demand patient portal calls be done, but when asked about safety metrics such as Stars Reports for the store, they are unaware of the increase in misfilled prescriptions. 

Thank you for the support and experience you provided during my employment with Walgreens. I wish you all the best and hope that the company will update its policies to reflect the needs of patients in the future.

Please provide edits/suggestions in a nice fashion üòÇ. I know I'm not the best writer.",2023-02-28,34

I'm not one to give up and I don't want to be the pharmacist that leaves retail and takes an easier job only to let other pharmacists in the profession suffer. I want to change something. I don't know if I will but I'm going to try. And with the added 8 hours that I'll have everyday from getting a hospital job I think I'll have time to push legislation and organize a solid court appearance.,2023-02-28,34

We have begged corporate for the last 5 months for increased hours, more staff, pharmacist help, anything and they have refused. With the changes in ohio medicaid, incoming prescriptions from new tricare and, express scripts patients, and closing of a local independent, we have been slammed with transfers. Yesterday our DM came in and insinuated that we were lazy and DEMANDED that we make patient portal calls. I have 3 certified technicians with over 4 years of experience, all of which are immunization certified. And 2 additional technicians who are new but very good. With NO overlap at all, our pharmacy does roughly 600 scripts each day with the exception of Friday-Sunday. I come in an hour early and stay an hour over EVERY day. I worked at failing stores that had no staff. I am good at my job and I multitask very well. I will not stand by and allow my technicians to cry everyday at work because they are overwhelmed. I feel for our patients, and I feel for the local pharmacies who will inevitably pick up our scripts. It's just not safe, and I refuse to get behind in order to make corporate money off of MTM calls that we don't see any of the profit from. In less than 24 hours I've already got 3 interviews lined up and my technicians have already found jobs elsewhere.

In my 10 years of practice, I have dealt with clown prescriptions and dangerous calls from mid levels, sure. And I have dealt with at least an equal amount of idiocy from MDs.

‚ÄîAmiodarone initiation with no monitoring? 

‚ÄîChronic triple antiplatelet therapy after a single ischemic stroke ?

‚ÄîBupropion for mood in a patient with active seizures?

‚ÄîNifedipine IR for essential HTN?

‚ÄîTransdermal fentanyl for an opioid na√Øve patient?

‚ÄîSliding scale insulin in a cognitively impaired patient who can‚Äôt reliably check her own blood sugar?

All MDs.

I call and speak to a nurse being concerned since usually opioids are reduced 25% when changing drugs. The nurse proceeds to tell me I‚Äôm calculating MME wrong and it is actually a dose reduction at 40 MME. I tell her to use an MME calculator to make it easier and walk her through it.

Then I call the doctor and ask to speak to the nurse, a ""nurse"" picks up (who I later find out is just an MA), who claims it's the standard procedure at their clinic. The pharmacist dispenses and the paitent comes to pick up. The paitent's mom then asks for a consult, during the consult, we find out  the paitent has not in fact taken tacro before. We halt the script and apologize to the mom, who is very greatful actually. 

So I call the ""nurse"" back again. At this point I ask for her license number, because she doesn't seem to know even the basics about dosing a very common med for her clinic. This is when I find out she is an MA and the doctor has told her to just say she is a nurse to ""make it eaiser on paitents."" Anyways, I get the doctor on the phone. He is extremely mad at the pharmacist for questioning his prescription and starts to yell at me. I then tell him that I just need to document that this is not a typo, and have him confirm the dose. He says "".03%."" So, it turns out the MA had just sent over .1% after being told to send .03%. Then I transfer the doctor to the pharmacist and we fill the .03% dose. But damn, I have never heard anyone be so mad that someone dare question their authority. 

Also, I reported him to the nursing board for inducing his MAs to impersonate nurses.",2023-01-17,38
761,Post,10e47ok,"""Most Accessible Healthcare Professional!""**A recent rant post triggered me into writing my own. Skip it if you want to avoid suffocating negativity.**

""Pharmacists are the most accessible Healthcare Professionals!"" was a mantra regurgitated towards me with glee all throughout college (which was over 15 years ago, for me). This sentence was incessantly repeated like some kind of victory chant, a pearl of undeniable wisdom that both utterly validated our role in the healthcare system while simultaneously being worn like a badge of highest esteem. ""American healthcare patients see their pharmacist nearly 20 times more often than any other medical professional!"".

This is true. And it's a problem.

See, the American Healthcare system is broken. Fundamentally, inexorably, depressingly broken. Most people are aware of this, on some level, but it's rarely as keenly apparent, as frustratingly raw, as it is at a pharmacy counter. And even in the rare scenario that the utter lunacy of the system slaps someone in the face elsewhere, patients don't often have a human outlet for their rage. When you go to an Emergency Room that's ""totally in network"" on your insurance with your ""no-strings-attached $500 copay"" only to find out that the ER physician that saw you is out of network and the radiology group contracted to do your imaging is also out-of-network and you actually owe Aetna $4800 for that 2 hour ER visit where you received nothing but an x-ray, blood work and a 500mg Tylenol, who are you going to call? Who are you going to scream at? Aetna? HAH. Sure, call. Speak to some $2 an hour Bangledeshi call-center operator about your unhappiness. Let me know how that works out for you. You'll never see that ER physician again, nor will you ever meet an executive for Aetna. You know what Healthcare professional you stand face to face with all the time, though? Your pharmacist. We're ""America's most accessible healthcare professional"" afterall.

In our white coats and with our fancy letters after our name, we become the embodiment of everything sickeningly wrong with the American medical system. Because who else is there? When you come into the pharmacy for your ""totally life saving"" new drug the doctor wrote for you, who is telling you that *""actually, that product is non-formulary - we submitted a prior authorization form to your doctor, but your insurance company requires that you have tried, and failed, three other treatments first and our records show you have never filled those. So you can pay $1800 for a one month supply or likely have to return to your doctor's office and talk about alternatives.""* Oh, right. That's you. You are. Who is the patient going to blow up at? It's not their doctor. It's not their insurance company because their PBM is a giant, multi-billion dollar nameless, faceless, corporate entity. But you're standing there in your little white coat and your ""Rite Aid pays me $50 to smile"" face. They blame you. And they hate you for it.

When your hopelessly Adderall addicted patient comes in for their 2-day early fill (after three phones calls and two tired excuses the previous days) and you have to tell them it's on manufacturer back-order and that no other pharmacy in a 50 mile radius will even answer their phone call about, who are they going to be upset at? The DEA and their ridiculous quotas? Chinese API manufacturers downsizing after Covid supply chain issues? Wild over-prescribing across the US increasing year-to-year controlled stimulant prescriptions by over 20% between 2021 and 2022? No, no, no. They blame you. It's your fault. They've been going to your pharmacy for years now. You should know they need it and have it in stock. No one else is having this problem (lol). You're incompetent and uncaring. It's your fault. They half suspect you're lying and really DO have it in stock and you're just punishing them because you think they're an addict and you think you're better than they are. And they hate you for it.

When your 65 year old belligerent workman's comp patient comes in for their monthly fill of QiD Morphine 100mg ER, #180 Oxycodone 15mg, #120 Hydrocodone 5/325mg, #30 Zolpidem 10mg, #180 Pregabalin 100mg and #120 Lorazepam 0.5mg which are all rejected **every. single. month**. and have been for so long that you have their comp adjuster's cellphone number on a post-it note under your keyboard... are they going to understand? HAH. No. They're going to swear at you. They're going to turn beat red and loudly proclaim to the other dozen people in line that ""it's a problem EVERY TIME they come to this shitty pharmacy!"" (that they refuse to transfer from) and that you had better call their adjuster right now or they're suing you. The only thing they have in their sad, small and likely short little lives left are those drugs and you're standing in the way of them like you always do. The insurance isn't the problem, the doses and combinations aren't the problem, YOU'RE the problem. And they hate you for it.

When an exhausted 30 year old single mother of three has to leave work early for the second time in a single week to bring her chronically ill 3-year old to urgent care (again), for a double ear infection and strep (again) and they come to your pharmacy counter 3min before you close (again) to pick up Augmentin and Cortisporin HC ear drops... and you cannot fill either one of them... The doctor wrote Augmentin 875mg QID on a script for a 27lb three year old and Cortisporin HC isn't covered by her insurance and it's $219... who's fault is that? As she clutches her SCREAMING kid, about to have a full on fuck mental breakdown and gut you with the signature pad pen, who is she thinking the problem is in that very moment? Do you think she's patient and understanding? Do you think her thoughts include *""Thank you SO much for catching that insane overdose the doctor wrote for my child, and I understand that the brand ear drop is very expensive and the insurance won't cover it. Even though you closed 2min ago and would really like to go home after a grueling, soul-sucking 12 hour day without even a lunch break, could you please call the closed Urgent Care and get transferred to an on-call service that will take 2 hours to answer back for me?"".* No. She wants her fucking medication and she wants it right now. The doctor said it would be ready as soon as she got there. She has to get up for her second job at 3:00am and her kid has been SCREAMING for 7 hours straight and she's not leaving without what the doctor ordered. She hates you. A lot.

When a 19 year old college girl shows up at 8:01am as you're still turning on computers at a store you're floating to last minute and have never stepped foot in before to pick up her birth control that was called in yesterday. But... there was a floater there yesterday too, and although you see the script was sent in at 9:17am the previous morning, you see 340 scripts in the queue that were never done. Your line now has 12 people in it, with two in the drive-thru honking their horns and your one cashier until 12:00pm just called out because she refuses to work with floaters. Fine, fine. You log in, pull up her script and realize the doctor sent in the non-FE instead of the FE version. You ask her if that's alright. She's incensed that the script sat here for an entire day and was never done. She wants the FE version because she gets anemic around her period. You inform her you'll have to call the provider. She says she leaving for a trip and needs to be at the airport in 30min. A person behind her in line yells that they need to get to work. The phone rings and rings and rings. Barely holding back your boiling rage you answer it. It's the person the 6th car back in drive-thru asking ""what the fuck your problem is"". In that moment, they all hate you. All of them. The 12 people in line. The 6 people in drive-thru. The half-dozen scripts you'll get calls on that day that were incorrectly filled the day before. The front-end staff. All of them. This is your fault.

When a 78 year old retired widow comes in January 15th to pick up her 21 medications, you ring her up yourself at the register. The total is $3800. You see, she has a Medicare Part D plan with a $4000 annual deductible that reset on January 1st. Two of her inhalers are $400 a piece. Her Budesonide EC is $1493. Her Mounjaro has a coupon card that doesn't work with federally funded insurances. She has 16 other things. She gets a $319 social security check every month, and her late husband's military pension barely pays for rent and utilities. She hasn't paid her gas bill in 45 days and her house is 51 degrees. She has $19 in her checking account. She doesn't know what the word deductible means, she can barely even read. Her only surviving child is in another country and she doesn't have a soul in the world to call for help. You wish you could do something for her, and if you have all the time in the world you might even be able to. Get her some coupons off manufacturer websites, see is she's eligible for low-income programs for her injectibles, get her a social worker from the office of the aging, see if the doctor's office has some samples.... But... you can't. You're alone. You're going to do 700 scripts alone that day. You have 180 orders in the queue, two phone calls on hold, an antibiotic to mix, three Covid vaccine boosters waiting in chairs outside and another 3 people in line behind her, one of whom you KNOW you haven't done the order for yet and explodes on you every time they have to wait. So you tell her you're sorry and she leaves with nothing. She sits at home under three blankets and shivers while her COPD plays a gentle, wheezing melody and her pulse-ox hits 87. And do you know who society blames for this? You. Fucking pharmacists, making $500,000 a year, driving to their mcmansions in their Ferraris and charging poor old widows $4000 for their drugs that cost is $0.02 to order from McKesson.

The US Healthcare system is fucked and at few other places does it become as apparent as a pharmacy counter. Because we're ""America's most accessible healthcare professional"" we often have the worst aspects of this shitty system foisted on our own shoulders. We're judge, juries and executioners of the opioid crisis after all, tasked by state and federal regulators with ""profiling"" patients based on red flags and made responsible for denying scripts and banning prescribers. That makes us very popular, treating half of our customers like criminals. Every drug shortage, every deductible, every coverage gap, every prior authorization, every unreadable script or provider outreach, every uncovered vaccination or has-to-be-order medicine... that's all our fault.

The other day was national pharmacist day and the local radio station had people call in and every phone call was just toxic as fuck about wait times, and pharmacies charging thousands of dollars for medications that cost pennies, drug shortages, pharmacists accusing patients of being drug addicts. General perception of pharmacists are that we‚Äôre wildly overpaid and glorified pill counters that know zero about medicine and exist purely to deny scripts and bankrupt people. Most callers presented some sort of sentiment along the lines of *‚Äújust let me go behind the counter and toss 20 amoxicillin in the bottle, it won‚Äôt take 4 hours and won‚Äôt cost me $99‚Äù*

People have no idea what goes on behind a pharmacy counter and they don‚Äôt want to. They want someone to blame for drug shortages, prior authorization, early refill denies, high prices, terrible insurance companies and corporate greed and we‚Äôre the perfect target. People hate us almost as much as police.

I realize 90% of these comments will have people waxing poetically about their large and loving customer base. About how that one woman bakes her cookies and that other guy named his god child after them. I've had those patients too. I've made those relationships. But you cannot deny the overwhelmingly negative public sentiment about our profession right now. People can hate us, scream at us, berate us and disrespect us to our faces because we're the only faces in the industry they really get to.

In fact, she was sitting in a separate room checking prescriptions and only came out for consultations.   I asked myself, why can't we have this?  It was a very organized system, and the pharmacist was allowed to focus on her tasks in a quiet, separate room away from customers.   It was amazing.

And you're so right about that ""most accesible healthcare professional"" statement.  It was bragged about in pharmacy school, as if it was a good thing!  IT'S NOT!  It's wrong, it's a serious symptom of a broken system, and it's UNSAFE for pharmacy staff!!!!",2023-01-17,38

771,Post,1078tis,"A WARNING ABOUT CVS PHARMACYI am a pharmacist writing this to spare you from suffering the same outcomes I have. This is a warning to not, under any circumstances, accept a position with cvs. It has ruined the lives of everyone I know that has worked for the company for any significant number of years. I don't know any pharmacists in this company who have not had to take antidepressants or anti anxiety medications in addition to a slew of other medications for their generally ruined health. Now, to my horror, I have realized that is happening to me as well. I was once an athlete, and now find that my ability to maintain my health has been permanently stolen now that that my feet and knees are destroyed to the point that I can no longer run or even jog. I thought it wouldn't happen to me. At least not this fast, but don't underestimate the damage that forced standing for 10-14 hours per day will do to you. Of course, you wouldn't have to stand all day if you weren't forced to constantly be doing the jobs of three people. But you will, because the intentional business model of this company is to never provide enough staff. I want to emphasize this point, because it is the foundation of a hundred other problems you will have to endure as a result. You will be expected to work at a level 10 frenzy of stress and misery while trying to type prescriptions, fill prescriptions, verify prescriptions, all while you have anywhere from 1-10 calls simultaneously ringing, shipments to check in and put away, lines of customers up to 30 feet long, and the expectation to give vaccines. Do you think you could do this with 3 technicians? How about 2? No? How about 1? HOW ABOUT ZERO? Regardless of the store's prescription volume, you will always have half of the staff that the job requires. 

&#x200B;

The staffing shortage has been absolutely crippling for years, and we were completely dumbfounded to find out that now, during the busiest part of the year, staffing hours have again been cut. So here that means most stores have 1 to 2 technicians working when 5 are actually needed. As a result, quality of service and safety are almost non existent. How would you like (on top of having an already miserable life courtesy of your employer) to have your license suspended for a safety violation when it was really the fault of your employer who provided absolutely none of the logistics required to do your job correctly and safely? Don't be surprised if it happens because I can't tell you how many stores have expired drugs on the shelves, misfills, incorrectly billed prescriptions, misfiled documents, controlled substance inventory errors, mistyped rx's and so on. It is a daily occurrence. And it is compounded by constant quitting. People are always quitting because it is so miserable, so you always have new and inexperienced people working, hence an even greater propensity for errors. And don't think the state boards of pharmacy will do anything. We've tried. They sit firmly under the thumb of cvs. Anything they ever (extremely rarely) do is just for show and changes nothing. Most of the time they simply won't respond.

&#x200B;

Any pharmacy school that doesn't caution their students about cvs is negligent. But because many of them are, I am speaking out to make sure you know that this company will ruin your physical and mental well being, your relationships, your career, your happiness, and your life. Share this with everyone you know. Under no circumstances should any of you ever work for this company, and absolutely never financially support this company by having prescriptions filled there.",2023-01-09,39

I used to work as a tech at CVS a couple years ago. We had one of the sweetest, kindest pharmacists working there. One day, an older patient randomly collapsed in our parking lot. The pharmacist did everything she could to save the patient before the ambulance arrived, but sadly the patient ended up passing away. 

Our pharmacist was visibly very shaken up (as anyone would be) and tried requesting a day off the following day. ONE day off to relax and get it together after experiencing someone die under her own hands. DL said no and made her come in. 


I felt so bad. The stress was physically affecting her to a point where all her muscles were extremely stiff and she couldn‚Äôt move/rotate her neck.  She looked defeated and generally unwell, but had to work through it anyway. After a significant trauma, CVS made her come back to work in the toxic environment they created. 

That was the day I realized this company was just plain evil. They will watch their own employees deteriorate mentally and physically and won‚Äôt give a single shit about it.

This prescription was sent into my pharmacy at 8pm after a cardiovert. I was honestly shocked when I saw this. I stopped everything I was doing to call and clarified the dosing. I had to leave a message for the triage nurse to contact me back. Instead of calling the pharmacy, they left a message on our prescriber line. ‚ÄúSorry, it was suppose to be xarleto 20mg tablet every 12 hours.‚Äù That didn‚Äôt even make sense either. I gave the patient two tablets until the next day, so they had something to hold them over. 

I finally was able to get ahold of the PA to clarify. I try my best not to step on anyone toes when calling on mistakes. ‚ÄúHey this is blah blah. Just wanted to call and clarify the dosing on this apixaban. I am not familiar with the indication, so I just wanted to double checking the dosing. Is it suppose to be 4 tablets every 12 hours?‚Äù Without any hesitant, she said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs looks like what cardiology wanted. Let me look at the note. Yep‚Ä¶ xarelto 20mg.‚Äù I can‚Äôt believe I had to explain apixaban is eliquis and xarelto is rivaroxaban. That was truly embarrassing and dangerous.

818,Post,z1c6vz,"Very unprofessional nurseNo need for any nurse fans to get their panties in a bunch. I do not think that all nurses are this terrible, but this was just a really frustrating experience I had to share.

So an infectious disease doctor sends an antibiotic Over to my pharmacy. My pharmacist looked at it and sees that it says two tablets twice a day. The correct dosing is one tablet twice daily. He asks me to put in for clarification with the doctor. I call and get a hold of a nurse. I tell her that we are wanting the doctor to clarify the directions because we think it should only be one tablet twice daily. She looks in the patient‚Äôs chart and tells me that the doctor logged it in there as two tablets daily, so it is correct. I tell her that I understand that the doctor put that, but we think that he made a mistake. She gets all pissy with me and tells me that she is reading it right from The patient‚Äôs chart and that we do not need to run it by the doctor. I said ‚Äú yes, we would like a clarification because we think the chart is incorrect and that the prescription was sent incorrectly.‚Äù

Then, she tells me that she is looking at the literature and that it states that the correct dose is two tablets twice daily. There is something about the way that she was speaking that made me feel like she was just lying her ass off. Partly because we had already looked into it but it was also just some thing about her tone. I finally just got sick of her shit and told her that we are not filling the medication until the Doctor looks at it again. She lets out the most obnoxious annoyed sigh and tells me fine, but we are just wasting their time. I said fine, just call me back when you get a clarification. Important to note, I could hear her friend talking in the background the entire time.

10 minutes later, her friend calls back. She tells me to go ahead and change the prescription to one tablet twice daily. So, as we expected, the doctor recognized his mistake and corrected it. I told her thank you and I get the prescription ready.

I was so fucking annoyed by the handling of this situation. The nurse that I originally spoke to just Acted like we were a bunch of idiots for questioning the doctor. If I did not press so hard with her, this could‚Äôve very well turned into a situation where the patient got way too much medicine. All for what? Because she has zero respect for Pharmacy staff? Because she didn‚Äôt want a pharmacist to be right and her or her doctor be wrong? Because she didn‚Äôt feel like getting off her ass and asking the doctor a question? Because she made a decision and just absolutely had to stick by it, no matter the consequences for the patient?

And then she can‚Äôt be mature enough to call me back herself? Sure, she could‚Äôve been busy, but I‚Äôm gonna wager that she was just a childish idiot who couldn‚Äôt stand the thought of admitting that she was wrong. People like that really need to get out of healthcare.",2022-11-21,44

She had to do multiple 16 hour shifts while she was sick (with a fever of 103). Her manager said he can't find a replacement and she has to come in.

Now we are in the emergency room and she has difficulty breathing and swallowing even a small amount of water and is in bad shape. 

I really don't know about the field of pharmacy but this kind of behavior is unheard of in my field (tech). She wants to go back to work on Monday but I told her I'm refusing to let her go and if her manager calls I'm giving him a piece of my mind.

Is this even legal ? What can we do in this situation because her boss is making her come back to work on Monday and she is in no shape to even walk without me holding her up.

Thank you !

Update: we are at the hospital and she just tested positive for COVID. She thought it was just flu because the at home test was negative but the hospital test showed positive for covid.

Update 2 : thank you for all the kind messages.

For the folks that say I should have stopped her, I tried ! What more could I do ? She is a grown adult and I can't do anything more than begging and pleading.

To the folks who say she exposed others knowingly: she works alone in a sterile environment. She doesn't deal with any patients and she is wearing a mask at all times even in her lab. She is with a big chain hospital but I won't divulege her specific specialty because it will be easy to identify her by her employer.

We are home from the hospital now and she is still in bad shape. I am also showing symptoms which sucks because I don't know who is gonna take care of her if I'm too sick. But hoping things get better soon (they gave her paxlovid).

Also, some context that might explain why she had a hard time declining to come to work : She went into pharmacy school as an older person and now she has a massive student debt and not too many working years ahead of her. Her husband (myself) has a debilitating chronic illness and we are not financially doing great. She is always afraid of not being able to get another job (because of her age) and not being able to pay her student loan.

920,Comment,ir2ha0s,"Things that my school taught but I never saw:

* Pharmacognosy
* Non-sterile compounding. My school spent so much time on teaching people how to make capsules. I never ever made any capsules by hand outside of lab. I did make creams, ointments, and suspensions, but I don't think I ever will get to make any capsules ever.
* PK/PD calculation. It's useful to have that PK/PD background so that you can explain certain things to providers when they have questions and/or concerns, and so that you have an idea of what a realistic timeline is when playing with warfarin, but I never calculated any PK/PD out of school besides from multiplying half-life by 5. Might be more useful if in industry and/or research.
* SOAP note. Maybe other places use it, but not my.
* My school's definition of professionalism.

Things that I wish my school would teach:

* Incident-to-billing.
* What a CPT code is. I don't need to be a coder, but I would have appreciated my school better if they have told me about its existence.
* What a provider status actually is. I am not sure what my school was trying to do by advocating provider status but not teaching students about it.
* How patient encounters with providers are billed.
* How PBM is destroying pharmacy.
* The existence of some clinically obsolete old medication that many geriatric patients still take. Oh, the confusion I had with albuterol tablets.
* USP797/800. Somebody already mentioned it I think.
* OBGYN. Prenatal care, preterm care, what an emergency is for pregnant women and/or fetus. Currently working at a rural clinic and pregnant mothers show up very often.

Not defending the system, but that‚Äôs always worth looking into to make sure you are giving correct information to the patient. People pick their plans for the year‚Ä¶ making sure to pass that info to them may make them better informed to pick a plan option better suited for their meds.

That being said when I worked independent, we did not accept/contract with GoodRx. Our cash prices usually beat them anyways (and sometimes beat insurance too after fees). Pharmacists had a calculation to determine what the cash price should be and if we were able to beat insurance copy we would inform the patient and let them choose which they would prefer, but always letting them know whatever they pay cash, insurance will never see or count towards deductible. You have a good heart to be in pharmacy and helping patients, but maybe discuss with the owner if there‚Äôs some sort of math or pricing table you guys can use to determine cash pay. This way you keep business, patients get meds, and there is fairness to patients/staff that there isn‚Äôt just 1 rph ‚Äúthat just gave it to me for $10 last month!!‚Äù and the patient becomes a terror lol.

959,Post,xhjsbu,"Finally, an anime about pharmacists!The anime is called ""Parallel World Pharmacy"". A tireless pharmacologist is on the break of a major discovery. Before he can bring the discovery to light, or realize his dream of retiring as the owner of a small pharmacy, he suddenly falls ill from exhaustion. When he awakens, he finds himself in a fantasy medieval world, where he has possessed the body of a young boy. Luckily for him, this boy happens to be the son of an archduke, and a royal pharmaceutist. With his knowledge of modern medicine intact, the reincarnated young pharmaceutist is poised to save his new world.

Has anyone started watching this anime, or read the light novel? I think it's great to see a portrayal of pharmacists in media. Not a bad show for kids either! Does anyone know of any other portrayals of pharmacists in anime?",2022-09-18,51

Worse, it sounds like something the bosses have been/are now aware of, and have chosen not to share with the employees.

I'm applying general business logic to hospitals, which doesn't always work, but it's a general truism that when the main suppliers start cutting you off, the business is done because it can no longer do business to generate cash to pay the suppliers.

Out of sheer curiosity, is this a hospital owned by a for-profit system?

Edit: Might want to use the weekend on generating those resumes - just struck me that the timing is mildly suggestive of a plan to e.g., file certain paperwork first thing Monday morning.  No direct knowledge, obviously, but the ship is sinking one way or another.",2022-09-16,51

I had had 1 cup of black tea about an hour before the appointment. They told me my systolic blood pressure was 144 mmHg. Fast forward 3 weeks, same technique by the staff and a similar result. Doctor told me she was worried about my blood pressure. I informed them my systolic usually runs 100-116 mmHg and that the high number was likely due to the incorrect blood pressure technique.

It's so bizarre. I'm trying to understand how they got to 5200 mg. 

I mean, 50 mg at bedtime I would understand, so if they were insane and were trying to type 50.00 and left out the period, I would get it. 

And it's not like they fat-fingered it, because ""2"" is 3 keys away from ""5"", and ""0"" is 5 keys away from ""5"". 

And if they had multiplied quantity (120 pills) by dosage to get to 5200, the dosage would have to be 43.3 mg, which doesn't seem likely.

About the only explanation I can think of, is they originally wrote 50 mg, but didn't fill in quantity, or had a different quantity, and so when they wanted to change quantity to 120, they may have already had the 1 in 120, and then got distracted, and then their cursor ended up in the middle of the 50 mg, and they typed the 20... and then not seeing the 20 pop up in the quantity field, they moved the cursor up there to complete the 120, and didn't see the erroneous 20 in the middle of the 50, making it 5200.

I asked the RN if the doctor was available so he can give me a verbal or if she can scan over a written order. She passed the phone to the doctor where he proceeded to verbally abuse me. Questioning my experience, knowledge and competence.

I remained professional over the phone and informed him that it is out of the scope of an RN to give a verbal order. He said I was wrong and that we have always been doing that with no problems. He wants to arrange a meeting with my director which I was okay with.

I received no patient name, drip rate, amount of bicarb or type of bag needed. He just hung up. I had to call back a different ER doc to gain information.

Am I wrong here? I was under the impression that nurses cannot provide verbal orders to RPhs? I am going to scour the internet to find some laws supporting my claim.

I'm a new PharmD grad with fair bit of confidence in osteoporosis (did grad studies) in Ontario.

I saw that a 90y F patient on blister pack (C-PAK) has been on risedronate for 7 years so I suggested to MD about taking drug holiday if not high risk (I can't find out what T-score is without so I expected MD to consider and decide). Plus I expect MD to elevate therapy to teriparatide if high risk at this point.

I was away for a bit and MD accepted the suggestion, asked us to remove from blister pack, but did not tell the patient (I wrongfully assumed MD would communicate).

I came back 3 weeks later, patient's daughter called pissed off demanding to know why it was taken out. I explained that bisphosphonates cause bone remodeling to halt and speculatively cause accumulation of microfracture over time, which, as demonstrated in studies elevate atypical femur fracture risk; thus, drug holiday for 1-3 years is an option exploring for her mom, obviously all in layman's term.

She lost her shit at me saying I'm not a doctor (which is why I faxed MD to get their take/decide) and should not make suggestions like that, I precipitated this and it's all my fault, and that she'll report me (probably to franchise and college) for not communicating with them prior to making suggestions.

I thought I advocated for the patient's health, but man it sucks that only return to it is angry yelling for 20 minutes and threats to report.

And the store was hella busy. Thought it was a joke at first but then he said hurry up and that he got a weapon. At this point I was kinda in shock and I don‚Äôt know why but I still asked him for his name and dob. he almost gave it to me too lol Now I don‚Äôt recommend this but I kinda knew he was bluffing and that he was a bit challenged. So when he handed me his bag to put the drugs in, I told him I can‚Äôt touch it due to Covid and that I‚Äôll grab a bag at the register. I grabbed a plastic bag and went over to the oxybutin and put like 3 bottles in there. Handed it to him and he left. All this happened in like 5 mins. My techs asked me what happened and I just said we just got robbed lol then I went back to giving vaccines.

My CVS store layout had the gift cards in front of the pharmacy. Someone called the pharmacy asking for all the gift card numbers and I said no and hung up on him. He called again saying if I didn't give it to him, he was going to detonate the bomb he has at CVS and shoot any employee that tried to leave the premises. I hung up again, told the shift manager then called 911. Police came and did an investigation outside the building and found an ""unspecific box with a blinking light"" near the drive thru window and didn't know what it was so they called the bomb squad to come in. Several more cop cars came to barricade the door and escort us to the local police station while the bomb square came to investigate.

1144,Post,v02vsz,"I‚Äôm so done with the disrespect and tantrums from full grown adults‚Ä¶I work in retail and today was a day my friends.. I‚Äôm talking about those shifts where you just drive home in silence because you don‚Äôt want to hear a single sound anymore. It‚Äôs a holiday weekend, of course everyone is rushing around trying to get to where their going and man were people miserable today. By hour 7 into my shift I had some guy stomp up to the pharmacy and come over towards where I was standing at the fax machine. He leans across the counter and bangs it with his hand to get my attention and goes ‚ÄúHey!! Where is your >insert name of a medical grade cream we didn‚Äôt sell that I‚Äôd never heard of before<‚Äú And I ask.. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs it used for?‚Äù He goes ‚Äúwell obviously it‚Äôs a cream genius. A BARTER cream where is it?‚Äù As I proceed to ask more questions to decipher what this asshole is trying to find he throws his hands up in the air and says ‚ÄúJesus Christ you‚Äôre a pharmacist!!! Didn‚Äôt you learn what a BARTER cream is in school?‚Äù 

At this point I‚Äôm just staring at him because I realize he‚Äôs looking for a BARRIER cream. I‚Äôm annoyed at this point with this guys attitude and the fact that he thinks he‚Äôs just going to walk up and insult me then expect me to help him. So I continue to glare at him for an uncomfortable amount of silence and finally say ‚ÄúNope, we don‚Äôt sell it.‚Äù And then he replies in a snarky voice ‚Äúoh you don‚Äôt sell it do you? You don‚Äôt even know what it is!‚Äù I literally grabbed the paper I was copying off the fax machine, looked at him in silence and walked right past him back to my verification station leaving him standing there‚Ä¶. 

Could I have helped him? Absolutely. But I chose not to because I am so sick of customers thinking they can just come in and shit all over us just because we‚Äôre  wearing a uniform. I‚Äôm done. I can‚Äôt do it anymore. People need to learn how to act again. I go above and beyond for my customers but I‚Äôve made a personal promise to myself that the ones who come in with the attitudes, the disrespect,  the bullying of my technicians, just looking for something or someone to fight, are not getting fuck from me until they can check themselves.

1148,Post,uyj4fl,"The patient is on the floor when you arrive.But, from what you can tell, he's still breathing and has a pulse. A rapid response nurse and a nurse from the floor confirm this. You let out an almost imperceptible sigh of relief. After all, this unit was only meant to house patients who need to be monitored overnight post-surgery, anyway. A code here could've been a nightmare. You'll stick around for a minute or two, make sure there aren't any pressing needs before returning to the pharmacy. You glance at your watch, notice the ""05:24,"" and feel your spirits lift that there's only another hour left on your shift.

But, as the patient is being moved back to his bed, everything changes. It begins with a soft clamor and some confusion about whether a pulse can still be palpated or not. This quickly grows to a contained panic as a nurse confirms from near the patient's groin that he can't feel it. So much happens in the next instant, it's impossible for you to process linearly. While you scramble to wheel the crash cart into the room, you observe the commotion rise to an explosion of human bodies in motion when a resident loudly announces to begin compressions.

Roles are quickly delegated and when the inevitable question is asked, you respond firmly, loudly, and without hesitation: ""I'll do meds."" When it's asked who's keeping time, you notice that there is currently nobody on-scene yet with the institution's time-keeping app for cardiac arrests. As a rapid response nurse quickly tapes up a piece of paper towel to a nearby cabinet and readies a pen, you offer to help her keep time for all drug pushes, to which she heartily agrees and thanks you.

You dance around the cart and a wealth of bodies quickly shuffling past you as you duck, unplug the defibrillator, untangle the power cable, and assist a nurse with setting it at the foot of the bed before flipping the monitor on. A medicine resident assumes his position by the now beeping monitor while an RT is getting settled in near the patient's head, bag already in place. On the side of the bed opposite you, a short line to tag in for compressions is forming.

While the first round of compressions continue, you try to assess what more you can contribute at this point and realize that nobody has established what the patient's parenteral access looks like. You find a floor nurse who currently appears idle and pull her over to ask. ""He's got a 20 in the right AC that's got great return,"" she responds. ""So just the one peripheral, then?"" you clarify. As she confirms, the attending running the code takes notice of the discussion and asks for another line to be placed.

""PULSE CHECK/RHYTHM CHECK!"" The room falls silent and collectively breathes as the resident furrows his brow and concentrates on the monitor before him. ""Nothing."" He looks to the nurse palpating the femoral who confirms the same. ""Continue compressions!"" sounds the inevitable call.

You check your watch. ""Less than a minute until next epi!"" you call out firmly while your hands are already in motion, slicing the top of the tan box open with your thumb and dropping the disassembled syringe safely into your other hand. As you hand the assembled syringe to the rapid nurse that's now positioned himself next to the pt's newly-placed IO in the distal tibia, your other arm is already back in the guts of the med tray of the cart, blindly groping around for the small bundle of flushes that it comes with. The attending asks the rapid nurse to push drugs through the already-existing antecubital access, which the rapid nurse obliges.

As he pushes the epinephrine, he looks up and announces it. He's met with a confirmation from the time-keeping nurse who repeats that epi is in, along with the current time. Next to her now, the paper towel is slowly being adorned with descending timestamps and barely legible pen scribblings next to each one.

The process repeats three, maybe four, more times. Multiple residents, likely from anesthesia, are starting to line up for compressions now. The room is beginning to lose hope. But at next pulse check, you notice the medicine resident's brows furrow deeper than usual. ""V-fib...?"" he asks. Another medicine resident and a rapid nurse lean over from where they're standing to scrutinize the scribble working its way across the monitor. All parties conclude shortly in a consensus of fine v-fib. As the resident announces the plan to shock the patient, he confidently confirms before the common confusion arises: ""Please continue compressions while we charge. We will clear the patient right before we shock."" You nod, approvingly. It always surprises you how frequently people forget this. The compressions resume as a nurse, panting, tags out with a resident.

The medicine resident leans over the bed and attempts to work the defibrillator. When you recognize the struggle, you quickly make your way over next to him, flip the monitor to defibrillate, and dial up the dose to 120J before instructing him in a few words on how to charge and shock. ""Charging!"" you and the resident shout in unison as the unmistakable, ear-piercing tone of the defibrillator charging fills the room. After a few long seconds, the tone descends to a sustained beep while calls of ""Clear!"" start to fill the room.

The compressor steps away. Immediately, the patient's body convulses violently in the bed, once. Not a moment passes when the patient comes back to rest when the medicine resident announces to immediately resume compressions. You nod approvingly to yourself again. Sadly, you've seen this fumbled before too.

The next few rounds of CPR ensue. A few nurses stand outside the room and observe. You make eye contact with one and ask her bring a box of flushes to the code, which she hurriedly sets off to do. The v-fib reappears and is shocked again. You mentally note that the pt is shocked, again, at only 120J. You hand out a few more supplies from the cart. A c-collar. An IV start kit. ABGs, and enough to draw a rainbow for labs. A litre of saline. In the systematic chaos, you struggle to prime the saline with IV tubing after accidentally opening the admixture port out of force of habit. As the code blue alarm continues to reverberate behind you, barely audible to you by this point, you shake off your brief confusion and find the tubing port shortly thereafter.

You take stock of where the code is at and begin to triage how you're going to spend the next 60 seconds. ""30 seconds until next epi!"" announces the time-keeper, who has now managed to get logged into a computer to access the code narrator. The cart is out of the tan-boxed prefilled syringes of epi and you're now down to manually drawing up your doses with individual vials of both the drug and saline.

You busy yourself with getting the next epi ready. As you cap off the safety needle, unscrew it, and hand it to the nurse while informing him of what it is, you immediately set off next to find the small brown baggie marked 'Amiodarone.' You struggle to find it for an agonizingly long 5 seconds. When you finally do, you immediately dump two of the vials into the palm of your hand and sit them on top of the cart. A pulm/crit care fellow, standing nearby and outside the room, is observing you work and you pray he doesn't see your hands shaking while you draw up the solution, now infamously frothing from having been tossed around and inverted so much. Maybe next time, you'll skip out on that second energy drink of the night.

The v-fib reappears again. You make it a point to ask the resident at the foot of the bed if we can charge to 200 this time. He nods his assent and dials the dose up. The room, having been through this song and dance twice now, yell clear in a commanding unison before the patient is shocked.

As the patient comes back to rest and CPR restarts, you make eye contact with the attending, standing across from the bed from you now, and ask if you can give amio next. ""300, right?"" he asks pointedly, clearly having witnessed the same mistake as you before. ""Exactly, 300,"" you respond, your breath now starting to fog up your glasses from beneath your KN-95.

""Go ahead and get it ready.""

""Already done,"" you shoot back, before next turning to the nurse by the antecubital access, handing him the prepared syringe, and stating ""This is 300 of amio."" As the nurse pushes it, the attending nods his thanks to you.

By now, a rapid nurse has had to call out into the hallway for more volunteers for compressions. More nurses and residents from inside the room quickly volunteer to jump back in while a few from outside trickle into the room in order to fall in.

Over the next few rounds, the patient goes back into asystole, before the v-fib appears a few checks later. You've lost count of how much epi you've given by now. You've long since exhausted the cart and have had nurses run you more vials from your code bag, now comfortably well out of your reach and outside the room. As the patient is shocked yet again, you ask the attending if you can give another dose of amiodarone. The attending, reassuringly detail-oriented as always, confirms the dose of 150 mg. Again, you've drawn it up ahead of time and hand it off to the nurse.

The rhythm disappears again over the next few checks before popping its head up again. As the patient is shocked yet again, and yet another compressor tags in to resume the brutal task at hand, the attending begins to ask the room if anyone else has any ideas left. This is the beginning of the end.

""Well, at this point,"" you begin aloud, working your way down your knowledge of ACLS guidelines, ""we have v-fib refractory to multiple shocks and multiple pushes of amio. Lidocaine would be our next shot."" It's as if you've suggested the sky is red. Multiple doctors disparately wonder out loud, ""Really?"" The attending turns to you and asks, ""Can we still do that even after having pushed 450 of amio?"" Chest compressions continue, but the entire room is focused squarely on you. Internally, you panic. It's a reasonable question, not one you've really thought about.

You decide to stick to your guns and to trust your knowledge and experience. ""Yep, absolutely. I've had good experiences with it under similar circumstances before."" The attending chuckles and agrees, while wondering aloud what those experiences were. You're already scrambling to the side of the room that has the patient chart pulled up, phone in hand, to crunch a rough weight-based dose. You‚Äôve only seen this done once before, and this is your first time doing it yourself. Your brain starts to grind to a halt doing the arithmetic, but thankfully, another anesthesia resident who has been following your work finalizes your dose in CCs. ""Close enough to a whole syringe,"" you both conclude.

You thumb the top of the pink box open, assemble the syringe and hand it to the nurse. As another hopelessly long minute progresses, CPR continues. ""Good compressions!"" the monitor announces in a crackly monotone.

When it's finally time for the next rhythm check, you hear the monitor beeping rapidly to life. You snap your head up, and faintly make out a rate of 74 or so from the corner of the monitor. ""We have...definitely something,"" the resident muses aloud. He turns to the nurse planted by the patient's femoral and asks, ""Do we have a pulse?""

The pause is pregnant and feels like an eternity. ""I feel it!"" the nurse exclaims. While nobody audibly cheers, the change of atmosphere in the room is instantaneous and electric. The team begins to shift into post-ROSC care. You feel dizzy and genuinely astonished that it worked. The sounds of the point-of-care ultrasound machine loudly fill the room and snap you back to reality. Confusion ensues about where to obtain a central line kit (you quickly solve this by grabbing the one stashed at the bottom of the cart). You task a couple floor nurses standing outside with obtaining an IV pole, pump, and adequate channels to run pressors and sedation when you realize there's none in the room. A resident working on a progress note outside the room asks you for an update of the meds given to this point.

The following hour is difficult. After central/arterial lines are placed, you find yourself staring at the monitor which flatly spits out pressures in the 40s/20s. The pressors running are at obscene rates that feel incompatible with life. The attending, a few residents, and a nurse are away updating the wife on the situation, when you notice a nicely dressed man standing at the corner of the room, stethoscope hanging around his neck. The only reason you recognize the attending neurosurgeon of the primary team is because of the pictures you've seen of him in the local news media and in hospital advertising. You check your watch and realize it's past shift change at this point.

""We need to take him to CT. I need to see his head,"" he states plainly. The care team balk. Someone manages to ask why. ""Because, if I want to sleep tonight, I need to know what the hell happened."" His mask appears to hide a sea of emotions. Nobody dares to argue.

3 floors on the patient transport elevator, and 10 minutes, later the code resumes not 30 seconds after you manage to move the patient onto the CT table, surprising nobody. You manage to spot a crash cart you weren't expecting to see all the way out here, and rip open the ziptie lock to get to the med tray. The pharmacy clinical specialist from the day team is here by now to relieve you, but you assert to her that you can stay to finish this one out when asked. One round of CPR and a push of epi later, an anesthesia resident bursts in and announces loudly to stop compressions and that the wife wants nothing more done.

For an entire, painful minute, his stethoscope searches multiple spots on the patient's sternum before he confirms their death. You check your watch and read the time off. Confirming, the resident bluntly states, ""Time of death: 07:32."" That‚Äôs 0 for 3 this week.

You get ready to gather your materials and go back to the basement, before the resident speaks again, halting everyone in their steps. ""Can we have a moment of silence, please?"" Everyone bows their head, before the resident asks the room for the patient's name. He repeats it when told, then after a short pause, adds, ""Go with God."" The room continues the palpably respectful silence.

Downstairs, you pull the patient's chart to begin your intervention documentation. Upon attempting to state the patient's reason for being here, you realize you actually don't know. You pull the H&P. This was a 57 y.o. M who presents electively after referral from outpatient psychiatry, thought to be a good candidate for a neurosurgical procedure for treatment of his major depressive disorder, refractory to over 20 medications.

1166,Post,usm9p3,"25 years a WAG Pharmacist: An Expos√©I was inspired to write this after reading [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/pharmacy/comments/unaujk/lunch_options_for_retail_pharmacist/) posted earlier on this sub. It reminded me of 25 years of my dad going hungry. One thing is for sure to all the WAG RPhs here: DEERFIELD. DOESN'T. CARE. ABOUT. YOU.

# Disclaimer

Nothing in this post reflects the feelings, experience, nor employment of my father by any means. These opinions, views, and data points are all my own, collected on my own accord. There was never any exchange of patient information, nor any information about Walgreens Boots Alliance nor its subsidiaries disclosed to me during my father's tenure at WAG. For more information on digital privacy and cybersecurity, refer to[ HIPAA](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security/laws-regulations/index.html)

I'm no PharmD, but my father was an RPh at Walgreens for 25 years. My mother was a practicing pharmacist in her home country before becoming an RN in the U.S around 20 years ago.

I can't speak to the experience behind the counter, but I can speak to how terrible Walgreens treats their most experienced pharmacists in the greater Chicago area, and how it affects their children (I'm an adult now).

# No, you're never guaranteed a permanent store.

My father had a permanent store for a long period of time. However, after many years there, he was moved to be a floater. In Illinois, floaters in the day time are abundant in some districts. There were 54 active floaters in our region alone. My father, thanks to his seniority, was able to secure stores easily, but was always only notified within hours of the start of the shift. Some weeks, he'd be lucky to secure at most 30 hours of work. Never at the same store more than two shifts in a row. The worst part is that some of these stores could be up to 60 miles away from home. During that time, there was never room for day trips anywhere. No family vacations. My dad would be working 2-10 P.M, but as most retail RPh's in this sub know, that meant 1-11:30 P.M for him. And his scheduler could call at any time. I even knew her by name; as a 12 year old kid, I probably had over 30 store numbers memorized from when she called the house phone while my dad was sleeping.

# No, Deerfield doesn't care if someone died.

Although a floater, he still had a home-store and a trusted manager. One day, my dad came home and I saw him cry for the first time in years. His manager worked a 2-10 P.M shift, and didn't get to leave until after 11 P.M, when 5 inches of snow threw his car into a ditch. He was found dead in the car. Did WAG send any support? Were any mental health services or time off offered to the employees?

No, it was back to work for the whole store the next day. Being an immigrant, my dad of course bottled it up, but this event affected him for the rest of the working fiscal quarter. I never got over the fear that it very well could've been my dear old dad. After all, floating had put well over 200,000 miles on his car. After that, I would stay up and leave the kitchen light on. I'd say I had homework (I was in middle school, maybe high school at the time) but in reality I was just killing time waiting for him to get home. WAG never paid him extra for the late night risks, travel, or last minute shift and store assignments.

# Overnight shifts will ruin you.

Years later, my father became a permanent, night time floater. He was the only night time floaters in the greater Chicago area at many times, and the schedulers always insisted it was due to his seniority and trust. They weren't wrong; I'm sure there aren't many PharmDs among the 900+ stores in Illinois that could just be placed anywhere, overnight, and alone at any given time out of nowhere. As a kid, I thought my Dad was incredibly cool (which he is!) for being one of the 'few trusted' RPhs. In reality it was just corporate trying (and failing) to stroke his ego to keep him in his hole. No matter how hard he tried, he never got any priority in bidding for a new store -- it always went to new grads. He was nocturnal, arriving home as late as 10 A.M, sleeping until around 6 or 7 P.M to get up for his shift. I sometimes got to see him before then if it was a weekend and his caffeine withdrawal (which is still the most hilariously ironic thing to see in an RPh of all people) would wake him up. This continued for 6 years. He would always bring a lunch bag with him, but would always bring back 'the leftovers' for me. In reality, he just didn't get a chance to eat. He was too busy filling upwards of 800 scripts that daytime RPh's had left behind. My dad would keep a journal of the amount of fills he had each shift, and after review, it's apparent that some nights had more scripts than his daytime shifts. He also has permanent lines on his face, bags under his eyes. His hands still have permanent callus scars from vice gripping the wheel on a cold Chicago night. Thank god for heated seats r/toyota. Daddo considered himself to be lucky to even have shifts. The 72 months of overnight shifts took years off his life, put wrinkles on his face, and changed who he was. He was constantly exhausted, irritable, and unavailable. All to provide for the family. I'd do anything to just relive my childhood and have my dad back for that period of time.

Years later, in 2016, just a year after the Boots acquisition, and Charles Walgreen III passed away, there was an abrupt decision to shut down the overnight stores, the new executives (WAG veterans know exactly who I'm referring to) chose to shut down overnight operation at many stores in Chicago to maximize profit. At the time, my father had an overnight role in the city. For a good few months after this, he was lucky to get 4 shifts per week.

# You are so, so, replaceable

My dad's seniority meant he trained many, many employees. From students on rotations, to new hired techs, he keeps letters and gifts given from his trainees in a box at home. From my own ballpark, at least 250 employees have learned under my father. I've tested his influence, and I found that over the course of around 223 different stores where I asked, 86% of them had my dad as a household name behind the counter. This didn't matter to Deerfield. At one point, after a long tenure at a permanent store long before he floated, his employment was in the balance. Without the union sending a rep to the district, his tenure at WAG may have been over. I donate to unions and support the Pharmacist union to this day and will continue to do so. I just wish there weren't conditions so bad that require a union to step in.

In 2020, I was home with my parents in the pandemic, and my father was working nearly 12 hours daily. No amount of 'we love our front line workers' made up for how exhausting it was, especially at his age now. The PPE shortage in Illinois was a struggle, and WAG made no effort to compensate the RPhs. There was no reimbursement for PPE. There wasn't even hazard pay, but instead there was just a couple hundred $ bonus to everyone. Don't like it? There's a desperate new grad ready to take your place. This affected all the WAG employees, and seeing the posts about it on this sub 2 years ago just broke me.

# It will affect your family at home.

I've learned a lot over the years. I've learned about medicinal chemistry, pharmacology, and everything else in between. I probably have memorized more compounds than 98% of other non-PharmD students at my University. I've learned about HIPAA, patient's rights, and everything else in between. I could probably sit for a PCAT and do decently well at this rate (In fact I got bored and took a practice test recently). I learned that Pharmacy means a *de facto* civic duty of being one of the few roles in healthcare where you actively are a patient's advocate against privatized insurance in the U.S; I learned why insurance is fucking bullshit; general brands are better; manufacturer coupons are a hidden gem.

What I also learned is that retail pharmacy takes you away from your family. It convinces you that you're doing a service for the public, and locks you in an everlasting battle between shitty providers, evil insurance, and impatient patients. I've learned that in retail, you're lucky to get a chance to eat. That you work more hours than an investment banker. That your time is barely yours, and your job exceeds the description. I've learned why some PCPs are arrogant, and why I shouldn't trust an NP or Radiologist's scripts.

My dad keeps letters he receives from patients thanking him for his service, emergency preparedness, advocacy, and everything else in between. It makes me beyond proud to know that he's had this impact, but makes me beyond livid every time I remember that there was no other reward than pride. My dad's time, energy, and youth was taken away from me and my siblings and mom by WAG, and there's not much more than barely over $60/hour, some stickers, and a handful of hazard bonuses to show for it.

I'm a hospital pharmacist, so I'm usually in scrubs which leads to the confusion (even with the badge).

A couple weeks ago, I was in an elevator with a person and they said, ""oh wow! Are you one of those travelling nurses that goes all over the country to help people?"" And I said, ""ah, no, I'm a pharmacist,"" and I see this guy literally slump his shoulders and he goes, ""oh..."" Awkward silence for the rest of the elevator ride. 

Today after work I decided to stop at the gas station for a drink and snack on my way home. The security guard started chatting to me and went so far as to thank me for my service and say, ""you must have seen some crazy things, my mom is also a nurse,"" and I said, ""ah, well I'm a pharmacist but yeah it's been a really hard year."" And he just went ""hm, well have a good night."" Like he was all excited to talk about it until I said I'm a pharmacist.

Obviously nurses have taken the brunt of the awfulness of the pandemic, not contesting that at all. But I had to watch those people die too. I had to deal with the awful medication balancing act and the knowledge that we had no answers in the early waves. I've watched coworkers burn out and quit pharmacy because of the trauma.

The average person on social media or seeing complaints written on your car aren't going to be upset that starting pay is $45/hr (about $90k/yr full time) when many of them are struggling to get to $15/hr.  There are many who actually struggle to survive, and implying we can't live on $45/hr is insulting to many people who live on far less and, i think would alienate support.

I dont think people care that we paid a lot for our degree and are in debt. Lots of people do that and it doesnt automatically entitle us to great starting pay. Instead people should be shown the value we add to healthcare, the costs we prevent in catching med errors,  and convince people why we should hold higher worth. 

And the only way to get chains to pay higher is if absolutely no one takes the bargain basement rates and forces their hand. CVS in my area spiked their rates back into the $60s with signing bonus this year after a couple years of being unable to staff many stores.

1227,Comment,i3omckh,"I'm in the parking lot roughly 10 mins before the pharmacy opens (cause ya know that's when we start getting paid) and by the time I get tills and swing the gates open it's on the dot. When I'm closing I already got my coat on and just waiting for the clock to strike on the dot to turn off the lights and close the gate. I got in hot water once for closing the gate 30 seconds before we officially closed ü§Æ but now I just wait until a till shows the correct time and the sign off slip is time-stamped lol I'm outta there within 10 mins.

Anyone coming in for Rx immediately 1 hr wait. I don't even answer the phones till 15 mins after we open. There is no emergency in the world for someone call me as soon as the system allows. 9-1-1 is the correct number for those problems.

Once had a guy ask me why I open so late. Sir, I opened on time, they don't pay me to come in early, you choosing to come right as we open isn't my concern. Had a tadalafil goodrx'r come in and demanded I go faster. Sir, the bottle you just handed me for refills still has pills left you don't need it urgently and if you did you shoulda called it in days before, showing up on my counter makes no difference.

1236,Comment,i34dpax,"I was a pharmacy tech retail worker for about seven years. At Walgreens, pharmacists often did 12-hour shifts without lunch or break because we were short-staffed. At Walmart, two pharmacists would overlap for about 2-3 hours, switching off taking their lunches. Many people believe that if there is no line, there is no work, which is not valid. Doctors now mainly send their prescriptions electronically. We also have to check in medications that are delivered daily. Pharmacists also have to give vaccinations, which leads to prescriptions getting backed up because it takes time away from verifying the techs' work. Pharmacists have to recount controlled substances, and they have to do C2 inventory every week. That‚Äôs just basics; we also have to call doctor offices and insurance companies every day. Doctor offices will often send incomplete directions, directions that don‚Äôt make sense, prescribe a strength that doesn‚Äôt exist, call them or fax them to let them know a medication needs prior authorization or a refill. Pharmacists will call them when there‚Äôs a drug-drug interaction.
And on top of that, we have to help the people dropping off prescriptions, people picking up prescriptions and providing us their insurance information, people adding manufacturer coupons for a lower co-pay, and answer phone calls that come in. It‚Äôs was hard trying to give the customers the undivided attention they deserved. Pharmacists and pharmacy techs should start a union to get the help they need. Corporations can surely afford to hire more people. They choose not to. A local pharmacy in my area was paying $7 more an hour than Walmart/Walgreens for techs.

1269,Post,te0vrd,"FINALLY leaving the world of pharmacy!TL;DR - Getting out of pharmacy into a Software Developer Role after 6 months of grinding making better money and better work-life balance.

I've worked in a pharmacy since my second year of pharmacy school as either a pharmacy cashier, tech, or intern. I graduated in 2013 and was a pharmacist ever since. It's been 13-14 years at this point and honestly was tired of it for far too long.

I entered the field for all the wrong reasons - my parents had the idea that a doctorate and a job in the medical field would be the best outlook for me in life. I honestly want to help people, but pharmacy as we all know is less of that and high liability customer service. My parent's viewpoint was understandable grown up in China during the cultural revolution where they faced starvation and financial instability. So as most ~1.5gen immigrant children do, especially one from an Asian background - I tried to be that obedient child and listen to whatever mom and dad said because they worked so hard...

Through my ""career"", I tried to like the profession and jumped around trying to find my niche - at the end of the day, it was just a grind for a paycheck regardless of where I went. I worked independent pharmacies, ambulatory care, hospital inpatient/outpatient, Onco/IV/Compounding, and corporate retail - all of them SUCKED. Come the pandemic right after I had my first child and everything was just horrible. I'm sure everyone can relate, to the level of uncertainty, the unnecessary safety hazards of being in the frontlines without ANY of the perks, benefits, or whatever else.

That was the final straw after I attempted a switch to a long-term care facility for disabled children with the recommendation of a close friend early last summer. It was something I actually wanted to do and am really passionate about - unfortunately, I got passed up for the position. At that point, I just realized I didn't want to deal with pharmacy at all anymore. At about the same time, I browsed LinkedIn and noticed an old friend who was also a pharmacist and transitioned to software development. I hit her up and turns out she went to a BootCamp during the early stages of COVID and now has a cozy cushy job at a financial tech company. We spoke about it over dinner and it sounded like a viable path for me as I was also a tech geek and passionate about making and building things. She was honestly surprised I didn't make the jump before her. 

In mid-August, I started to learn Javascript and managed to get accepted into a highly regarded BootCamp. I gave my employer plenty of notice and on September 30th, I left my M-F pharmacy job but still kept a Sunday position at another pharmacy for some side income. The following Monday I started the bootcamp. It was tough, 65+ hours a week for 13 weeks and ~$20k tuition, all while still working a Sunday job and taking care of a toddler. 

Luckily, I have an amazingly supportive wife and she support our family through the past 5.5-6 months, 3 of which were me grinding through the BootCamp and the last 2 being the ridiculous job hunt. If it wasn't for her I would have never made it through. And after hundreds of applications, several dozens of screening, and interviews, I was able to get 3 offers, all 6 figures with decent benefits.  But I decided to go with a remote Senior Fullstack developer role with a decent salary of $135k + 4% 401k match + annual bonus. It's been a crazy journey, but I really look forward to finally having a career, rather than being a pharmacist something that never felt more than just a job to collect a paycheck. I start my first day tomorrow and I'm both scared out of my mind and ridiculously excited!

1280,Post,t8b6x0,"I am a pharmacist and today I had to physically restrain a patient in the back of a police car and stop their suicide attempt.Buckle up, this is a bit of a long one. This is the top of my list for crazy in my 4 years as a pharmacist so far. This happened on Friday just passed.

I am a floating pharmacist and there‚Äôs a understaffed pharmacy is a small town I frequently go to all the time because I know how the store runs and I get along really well with the staff and a lot of the patients. 

There‚Äôs a few methadone patients there and one of them, who we will call Jason, deals with a lot of mental health problems stemming from a life of poverty and abuse since he was a child. While Jason can be quite strange, he‚Äôs usually very nice and appreciative of the help and support we try to give him. Personally I have pretty good rapport with him. 

Jason however is a very complicated case and has a hard time taking care of himself to the point where we daily witness all of his medication including holding onto his insulin and have him inject himself in the private counseling room because he won‚Äôt do any of this himself if he had it at home. He will always come in for his methadone however, so this allows for some consistent drug therapy. 

Today when I came in for my shift the manager told me that Jason, for reasons unknown, was in jail again and waiting to be transferred to a corrections facility in the city 2 hours away. This has happened before and what happens is the jail he‚Äôs held at will bring him up behind the pharmacy and we meet him in the police car to give him his daily witness methadone, anxiety medication, and his basal insulin and rapid if he requires it because he doesn‚Äôt eat great and his BG is all over the place. I was working at this store all weekend so she told me the police showed up with Jason that morning before I got there and he got his methadone, pills, and insulin for the day and he will be transferred on Saturday so I won‚Äôt need to worry about doing up any of his meds for the weekend.  Or so I thought.

I was working the closing shift, and at 4:30pm I get a call from the police officer at the jail telling me Jason is asking to come up to the pharmacy because there is something else he needs and wanted to confirm if he‚Äôs telling the truth or if he‚Äôs bullshitting him. I can see from his medication log that he received everything but his trazodone he normally takes with him as a carry for sleep. But he is also diabetic and it‚Äôs supper time so he might be looking for rapid insulin. I explain this to the police officer so he said ok, he‚Äôll bring him up in 10 mins. 

I get Jason‚Äôs rapid insulin and trazodone and bring it out back behind the pharmacy and go chat with him and ask him if that‚Äôs what he wanted and he said yeah he was gonna eat soon and needed a few units of rapid and wanted to take his trazodone to help wind him down for the evening. No problem. We check his blood glucose and it is 10.8 mmol/L so it is out of range already and recommend he take a few units. The officer said he would be fed when they get back. 

You can probably guess what happens next.

Now in the past, Jason has always self administered his insulin when he comes in for his daily meds, even when he was in custody. But this was the first time he asked to come up for rapid insulin while in custody so my spidey senses were tingling a little bit. He was in hand cuffs so I dialed the pen to his desired units and handed it to him when he got his shirt up. He seemed to be fumbling the pen and turned in his seat away from me so I started to lean inside the police car to offer holding the pen for a second while he got positioned and that‚Äôs when I heard him give two big cranks to the insulin pen, fully loading it.

Instantly I knew he was now trying to overdose and kill himself. 

**‚ÄùJASON, NO‚Äù** I said.

He quickly puts the pen in himself and starts trying to inject the whole pen and i immediately jump on top of him and grab his arm. Fortunately, I‚Äôm a pretty big guy about 270lbs and I like to go to the gym so I was able to stop him fairly quickly and wrestle the pen out of his hand since I am twice his size. The needle tip got bent during the struggle and I‚Äôm not sure how much he injected but there was still 28 units left on the dial when I picked it up off the ground. I ran back inside and grabbed some glucose tabs, brought them back and made him chew them. He started apologizing profusely for doing it but he‚Äôs so upset with his situation and he just wants to die and I felt very sorry for him. Paramedics showed up about 10 minutes later and checked his BG and it was now 8.8 so it was starting to drop but they took him to the hospital to monitor him. The day after the corrections facility called to confirm his methadone dose the previous and I spoke to the nurse about what happened and she told me that Jason told her the story and was thankful I stopped him. I told her to tell him I said Hi and I hope he‚Äôs doing ok. Some people have just been dealt a shitty hand in life and a little compassion can go a long way. 

And that‚Äôs why your prescription wasn‚Äôt done after 20 minutes, Karen. 

TLDR; daily methadone patient who‚Äôs diabetic was brought in by police for his medication tried to overdose on rapid insulin in the back seat of a police car and I found myself in the back seat as well wrestling the pen out of his hand. Karen gets mad because her prescription wasn‚Äôt done in 20 mins like we said.

Edit: since it needs clarification

1. I‚Äôm in Canada 
2. Nothing I have done violates any pharmacy law in the province I am from or any company policy of where I work.
3. We have an extreme shortage of doctors and many pharmacists are practically primary care specialists that go above and beyond for their patient‚Äôs.
4. People have said I should stick to doing my job and the police shouldn‚Äôt be bringing them to the pharmacy. It‚Äôs a small town, the jail there has no medical facility and is transferring them to the city jail which can take care of his medical needs. In the meantime, denying a patient methadone and insulin would be insanely unethical and I was doing my job 110% in this situation and I and no point in this story did I feel unsafe.",2022-03-06,72

We are constantly complaining about being looked down upon, treated like fast food workers, being excluded from the healthcare worker discounts, etc. Perhaps the first step to changing this stigma is encouraging people to call us by our rightfully earned titles. My name tag has my first name on it--why? My doctoral level license is hanging on the wall behind me, why shouldn't it be on my name tag? Why shouldn't I introduce myself to patients as ""Doctor Jellyfish?"" Maybe then people would stop screaming at me, asking me why I'm questioning their medical doctor, and treating me like a minimum wage worker (not that min wage workers should be treated poorly, but we know that's just how folks are).

1298,Post,t51r04,"Has anyone just refused to go faster at work??? To force management to address understaffingLast place I worked had chronic understaffing but I refused to work any faster to force management to address it. If the place burns down, its on management, not me. I have literally allowed phones go unanswered and medications get filled late, because management failed to staff me with adequate help. In that time, I caught multiple tech errors in filling. If I had rushed, I would've made medication errors, so I REFUSE to go any faster. If anyone yelled at me about medications being late, I told them exactly what I thought about understaffing. 

If pharmacy gets new billable opportunities like vaccinations, COVID testing, or being able to dispense legend drugs without a prescription (i.e. birth control, COVID drugs), shouldn't this be celebrated? The reaction should ""management needs to hire more people"", not  ""No, don't give us more tasks"".

1320,Post,szp6u9,"I'm confused. So what are we exactly? My wife took my daughter to her yearly physical yesterday with her pediatrician. The doctor asked her what career field she was interested in going into after high school. She told her she was considering nursing. 

The doctor responded, 'Oh, that's great, is there anyone else in your family in health care?' 

My daughter told her, 'My dad's a pharmacist.' 

The doctor kind of frowned and said, 'Oh, that's getting close.' 

It pissed my wife off, but she didn't say anything. In fact, she wasn't even going to tell me but ended up doing so later. 

I've been a pharmacist for over 20 years. For the most part, my interactions with doctors have been positive, which is great. There's always been mutual respect. Well, maybe not always, but you get my meaning.

But I'll admit, this one stung. 

When I was thinking about going to pharmacy school, my dad told me I would never be ashamed to tell people what I did for a living. He was a hard-working blue-collar guy who was very proud to call his son a pharmacist (God, I miss him).

Don't get me wrong. I'm not saying my self-worth as a pharmacist is tied to what ONE doctor thinks. She's a pediatrician who probably has very little to do with a pharmacy other than to call in antibiotics or inhalers. She's also a little older and probably never had a pharmacist save her from killing a patient as a resident. Don't know.

It doesn't surprise me when the general public has no idea what we do, but to hear it from a doctor? I thought we were at least on the same team. 

Anyway, sorry for the vent. It's just with everything else we've dealt with during the pandemic, from not being considered health care by certain stores and restaurants, etc. To hear this from a fellow health care colleague sucks.

I few years back my son got a pretty nasty infection from a bug bite on his foot. Had to get a prescription for it. I went to the pharmacy to pick it up and the man behind the counter asked if it was for me. I said ""No. It's for my son."" and pointed to him. He was about 5 at the time. I told the pharmacist it was supposed to be some kind of antibiotic. He gave me the strangest look then told me to wait a minute while he called the doctor. I didn't know what was going on, but I waited. 

Turns out, the doctor had accidentally sent in a order for some other medication that had nothing to do with antibiotics, in a dosage much MUCH higher than what would be prescribed to a child and equally unusual for someone of my stature. 

Thing is, as someone who isn't a doctor, if he hadn't caught that, I would've taken that medication home, fully trusting that what was prescribed was the correct medication.

I feel like I can‚Äôt let them go out into the world knowing literally nothing clinical so I end up putting a ton of extra work into rotations teaching them BASIC SHIT. I‚Äôm embarrassed to have them talk to physicians here because I don‚Äôt want the physicians to think we‚Äôre all like this. They aren‚Äôt going to pass the naplex!!! And if they do I can‚Äôt believe they will go out into the world of medicine representing my profession. 

I‚Äôm talking like, doesn‚Äôt know what guidelines to use for hypertension. Doesn‚Äôt know what covers MRSA. Can‚Äôt name two DOACs. Blown away when they found out lidocaine has anti arrhythmic properties. Doesn‚Äôt know how to find guidelines or the answers to the basic questions we ask each other. 

What am I even supposed to do? Do I fail them bc they‚Äôre unprepared or pass them because at least they‚Äôre working hard and professional? Refuse to take any more from that school knowing their other preceptors will just pass them along so they end up graduating with a doctorate regardless? Write a letter to the accreditation board? I‚Äôm so lost and so frustrated! 

I just don‚Äôt understand how you can earn your *doctorate* knowing so little about your own subject of study üò©

Why the hell would I treat a student differently based on what their job plans are after school? What if those job plans change? What the hell is wrong with you people

1432,Post,rzcurr,"An exit interview with CVSCVS Pharmacy: Today was my last day working for you. This is what I would say in an exit interview, but since you don't care, I'm posting it here. Your current situation is a prime example of how a business loses experienced and hardworking employees and how it develops a revolving door of brand new employees who quit within 2 weeks of being hired. 

The last few weeks for me at CVS have been nothing but stress-induced chest pain, headache and hives from trying to do it all with inadequate staffing, inadequate new hire training, and inadequate pay (for technicians). You could have properly staffed us before covid hit but you CHOSE not to. You could have paid technicians what they were worth but you CHOSE not to. You waited until a disaster struck and for people to reach their breaking point to finally do something about it, but ONLY because it hurt your bottom line. Even when boards of pharmacies fined you for dangerous working conditions, you brushed it off like it was nothing. What's a few thousand dollar fine when you are making billions every year? Even when pharmacist mistakes rose up during covid, you did nothing. You ONLY started doing something about it when stores started closing. A pharmacy cannot remain open without a pharmacist present in the building, and no one wants to work for you anymore. 

CVS, I just want you to know that it's your fault pharmacists can't eat, drink, pee, or sit down for 13 hour shifts. It's your fault stores are closing. It's your fault you're losing employees. It's your fault people's scripts are delayed. It's your fault the lines are long and wait times unreasonable. It's your fault patients are getting the wrong medications, directions, or dose, because pharmacists are trying to do more than they can handle. It's your fault employees are walking off the job in the middle of the day. It's your fault we close the drive-thru when we don't have enough staff. It's your fault a 41 year old pharmacist died of a heart attack inside a CVS pharmacy after experiencing chest pains because you pressured her to wait *2 hours* for another pharmacist to relieve her. And it WILL be your fault when a customer dies because they got dispensed a medication incorrectly. 

It is painfully clear to your employees that you were unprepared for the long term effects of a drawn out pandemic, and now are scrambling to hire as many people as possible, but it's too late. No one wants to work in a building that has caught on fire, even if it's a slow burn. No amount of raises and bonuses is worth working for you. 

But go on ahead, Karen S Lynch, enjoy your $11 million salary and before her Larry Merlo who conveniently retired in may 2021 to leave this shit storm HE created. Keep on bragging about your profit margins in the middle of a pandemic.

1438,Post,rvkedj,"Get out of my pharmacy!Both my manager and lead tech are out with COVID since Thurs. To keep my store going, I agreed to pick up my manager's shifts leading me to work 5 days straight, open to close, without any overlap. Today was the last day before my day off so I'm beyond exhausted and don't have the patience for nonsense.


Today, being a Monday right after the holiday and a new year, was unsurprisingly busy and hectic. While I was on the phone with my manager going over some things that needed to be done, I overhear an interaction between my intern and a customer (who wasn't even wearing a mask). I hear the customers voice get progressively louder and see other techs jump in to defend the intern telling the customer to calm down so they can talk. 


Apparently, he wanted to verify if an appointment was made for his mom for a PCR test that's *2 weeks* out. The intern was asking if he ever got a confirmation email or text (if they made an appointment they will get a confirmation code which is necessary to do the test) which he said he didn't. So the intern told him if that's the case, most likely the appointment wasn't made. This set the guy off and he got loud saying the appointment was made by United Healthcare and he was told it was x time on y day. My intern was telling him that we're not connected to United Healthcare and if they really did make the appointment,  they'll have to use the website like everyone else and would need his email and phone number so a confirmation would be sent to him. Guy refuses to listen, kept cutting her off and wouldn't let her speak and threw in a few f-bombs while he was at it. 


My intern is a very sweet girl who tries her best to help people so that prompted a tech to jump in to defend her. The tech told the man he's being rude and he needs the back off. And he said, ""WHO ARE YOU? I WASN'T TALKING TO YOU!""


At this point, I got off the phone with my manager and walked over and told him to get out of my store. I told him he is being rude and he doesn't get to talk to my employees like that. If he doesn't leave I'm calling the cops. Him, being the ass he is, told me to go right ahead and once again yelled, ""WHO ARE YOU?""  to which I reply, ""I'm the pharmacist,  this is my store. Get out of here. We don't welcome you here.""


He stared at me for a good minutes as if I would change my mind.  I pointed towards the direction of the front store and told him to leave. It felt nice to tell someone to gtfo. Got a little shaky afterwards  from the adrenaline but worth it.


Just felt like sharing the story. I think we get verbally abuse too much and we shouldn't be a doormat and take it. If someone is abusing your staff, step in and help them. No one has to take the abuse and you have all the power to tell someone to leave.

A medication mix-up is a major thing. Arthritis gel isn‚Äôt used after surgery. So I need more details. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry to hear that (and I was- I‚Äôve spent a great deal of my professional life looking at errors and trying to fix them in an error-prone system). ‚ÄúWhat medication was it? It has recently been available without a Rx, did you ask for it or have you had it before?‚Äù
Kevin: ‚ÄúYes I‚Äôve had it before, I got 3 big tubes of it for my hands two months ago, its how I knew it was arthritis gel!! Does nobody there check the meds before they go out?‚Äù

Me, now thinking this is a setup‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúYes, I see that you did get three tubes, and that was a one month supply. Did your surgeon tell you it was also for rectal use?‚Äù

Kevin: ‚Äúhe didn‚Äôt need to tell me that! Why did you give it to me? It burned so much around my incisions that I called the surgeon‚Äù

So now we‚Äôve established that Kevin did indeed shove his arthritis meds up his rectum, yet more juicy details are needed for a report.

Me: ‚ÄúOK sir, I see that you did get your post-surgery pain meds from us last week along with more arthritis gel. I‚Äôm not seeing the link that led you to use it rectally‚Äù. By now I was enjoying the conversation and using the term RECTALLY quite loudly. Kevin was on the phone, so there was no concern about violating his privacy or embarrassing him. 

Kevin: ‚ÄúI was getting my pain meds for my surgery. You should have told me they‚Äôre not for rectal use‚Äù.

Me: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking at the label that was attached to each box and tube of the rectal gel. The directions are quite clear, stating ‚Äúapply to hands up to 4 times a day‚Äù. At this point Kevin was getting annoyed I wasn‚Äôt understanding things.

Kevin: ‚ÄúWell I didn‚Äôt see it. When someone gets surgery meds they aren‚Äôt expecting arthritis meds‚Äù. Hmm‚Ä¶ fair enough I think. But we fill prescriptions for people for multiple maladies very frequently. 

Me: ‚ÄúOK Kevin, now, how are you taking your pain pills for your rectum?‚Äù
Kevin: ‚ÄúI swallow them, do you think I‚Äôm some kind of moron?‚Äù Ahh‚Ä¶ Kevin has laid down the gauntlet.
Me: ‚Äúwell Kevin, tablets and capsules can be taken by any orifice. ‚Äú
Kevin: ‚Äúit says on the bottle to take a tablet BY MOUTH every 6 hours for pain. Jesus you must be dense. Is there a manager I can speak with?‚Äù Oh, now he‚Äôs gone Karen on me. 

Me: ‚ÄúI am in charge of the pharmacy today. Now, let me get this straight so I know I have all the details. You put your arthritis gel up your rectum. This is a gel you‚Äôve previously gotten before. And your pain medication you took by mouth, and you‚Äôve never had this before. You read the directions for the pills but not the gel‚Äù.

Kevin: ‚Äúyes that‚Äôs exactly the problem! You should have told me not to shove it in my rectum.‚Äù
Me: ‚ÄúI can understand your dilemma. However, you receive medicaid. Federal laws dictate that we must counsel you on each and every fill. I can see your signature from where you signed stated you received counseling- both times in fact from getting your arthritis meds. I‚Äôm not seeing the issue here. They were clearly labeled, you‚Äô ve had the medication before, and you indicated you haven‚Äôt read it. What do you want me to do?!?‚Äù

At this point Kevin seem resigned that he was not gettting through to me. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to call the surgeon and talk to him. We‚Äôll see about getting a lawyer- you‚Äôve been negligent‚Äù. With that Kevin slams the phone down. Who still has a land line anyway?

Well, I better document this. I send patient care notes to his  surgeon and arthritis doc stating the problem, puttting his diclofenac gel for his hands up his rectum, and not following directions (Or common sense). In case he does more Kevin ‚Äòthings‚Äô with the  doctors- best to have a continuity of care and understanding his Kevin antics.

After closing I see a tired lady in scrubs looking at an endcap filled with junk. I ask if I can help-she‚Äôs also in healthcare and just looks drained from dealing with the burden of humanity. Turns out she‚Äôs a nurse with Kevin‚Äôs surgeon and she had received my care note but wanted to find out more. She also informs me the rectal surgery was to fix damage from objects Kevin had inserted to relieve constipation.

Well, Kevin never got through to me that it was my fault he put his arthritis meds up his butt. This was a 20 minute conversation, by the way. So the next time you‚Äôre wondering why your prescription takes so long to fill, its because we‚Äôve spent 20 minutes telling someone not to put something up their butt.",2021-12-25,80

This is a long post. My intent is to outline how APhA operates so pharmacists can be better informed as to whether or not to continue supporting them by paying dues. The facts that are laid out in the first few paragraphs are relevant and I felt like needed to be included so that pharmacists can fully understand what the APhA is really doing.


During my time in pharmacy school in the late 80s and early 90s, many of our professors encouraged us to join APhA because we'd only have to pay student dues (less than a pharmacist) and APhA represents pharmacists like AMA does physicians. Most of us students did this because students trust a highly respected professor. I enjoyed getting the publications, and found that the CE really helped me learn more about what I was being taught.


I won't bore you with my work details, except to say that 22 of my 29 years of practice have been in retail. I kept up my membership in APhA, because of the publications, the CE and the idea they were working hard to promote the profession. 


And sure enough, things seemed to be constantly improving. I had a pay raise in every single year of employment until 2019. From 2013 to 2018, I worked for an Independent Pharmacy, and we always had an abundance of staff. In 2018, I went to work for a grocery store chain, and during that year my staffing needs were met. It wasn't until 2019 that I got hit with a pay freeze and a reduced payroll budget. That was also the first year that this grocery store chain started pushing metrics down our throats.


Let me back up to 2013 when I went to work for an Independent. This was the first time I was really exposed to what has been going on with pharmacy reimbursement. The owner cussed PBMs every day. Our software alerted us when there were ""underpayments"" and ""clawbacks"". We began reversing ""clawback"" claims and that got the attention of PBM auditors. We quickly found out that our contracts **required** us to leave those claims on the insurance and collect a copay that was higher than our U&C price. We got paid the U&C, and the PBM ""clawed back"" the difference. We also were told that those same contracts that allowed for that also had gag clauses in them so we couldn't inform the patient that they were being overcharged by their insurance. It took legislation at state level in many states to correct these practices that seem borderline illegal.


Also during this time, I noticed that the nearby major metro markets were drastically cutting pay. One large national chain laid off every pharmacist in a nearby market, then allowed them to reapply for their former jobs. Of course, the new rate of pay was much less (sometimes more than $20/hour). They could do so because there were pharmacy ""diploma mills"" popping up all over the place and they were turning out enough pharmacists to flood these labor markets. I was working far enough away to think this wouldn't affect me anytime soon because my market did not have a school of pharmacy within a 150 mile radius, and the closest one was out of state. But sadly, a ""diploma mill"" popped up 50 miles away from my market and by 2019, they were flooding a rural market with pharmacists - many more pharmacists than the labor market needed and could support. 


While working for the Independent, I also learned about how legislation at the federal level was cutting into the bottom line more and more each year. Some of the things such as DIR fees started way back when Medicare Part D became law, and the intent was never to be used punitively against the pharmacies. Over the years, and especially once the Affordable Care Act was passed, these things such as DIR fees have been weaponized against retail pharmacy to the point that an Independent Pharmacy can almost not exist.


So by now, you may be asking how is the APhA the bad guy in any of this? Let's go back to the early 2000's when Medicare Part D was being hashed out. By and large, this was a mixed bag for pharmacy. At first it looked like it may be more beneficial than not. But Part D allowed PBMs to go from being wholesale products to retail products, with access to millions of Medicare beneficiaries. [Here is an article published in 2013 that explains how Part D empowered PBMs.](https://www.thirdway.org/report/how-medicare-part-d-beat-the-odds-and-why-policymakers-should-care) The PBMs had been around for more than 20 years at this point, but the game changer for them really began in 2006. During this time, APhA was not at the forefront fighting for us, and once the legislation went into effect, Susan Bishop, then Director of Regulatory Affairs for the APhA, said the Medicare Part D program started off with glitches, but she believes that many of the issues are now being addressed. In a nutshell, APhA was by and large absent, and had to address ""glitches"" after the fact.


Another **BIG** problem with Medicare Part D was that the Part D plans gave pharmacies non-negotiable contracts, which insisted upon the payment time frame and the reimbursement amount. Pharmacies were placed in a situation that if they didn't sign the contract, then they could risk losing the business. The APhA should have fought this part of the legislation tooth and nail. But at this point, they were asleep at the wheel.


Now we need to talk about what happened in the years immediately after Part D went into effect (2006). It is at this point that we need to talk about CVS. CVS began its takeover of the PBM market in 2007 when they purchased Caremark, one of the largest PBMs in the US. In 2015, CVS bulked up its PBM business by purchasing pharmacy service provider Omnicare, the leading provider of pharmacy services to assisted living, long term care and specialty pharmacies. Omnicare has about 13,000 employees, 160 locations in 47 states across the nation.  


[In 2017, CVS announced they had completed the acquisition of Aetna](https://cvshealth.com/news-and-insights/press-releases/cvs-health-completes-acquisition-of-aetna-marking-the-start-of), which is one of the largest health insurance companies and a PBM as well. This acquisition underwent ""scrutiny"" by a US federal judge, but it the end, CVS managed to pull off control of more than 1/3rd of the US PBM market share. In 2020, [Anthem ended a contract with PBM Express Scripts and partnered with CVS Health to form a new PBM IngenioRX](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucejapsen/2017/10/18/anthem-partners-with-cvs-health-to-launch-new-pbm/?sh=128f8e055740). Anthem is the largest BC/BS affiliate and it operates plans in 14 states. IngenioRX will be a full-service prescription benefit manager and enable Anthem to maintain its own prescription drug formulary. CVS Health will benefit through seeing more business in its specialty, mail order and retail pharmacy operations. It is important to remember CVS not only operates its CVS-branded retail pharmacies but also the retail pharmacies in Target stores as well. CVS will likely benefit by steering Anthem members into its store-based MinuteClinics.


Once again, APhA should have been fighting tooth and nail to lobby against one company buying vertically into the healthcare market at so many levels. How can an Independent Pharmacy compete with a company that owns the Insurance Company your customers have; the PBM that reimburses you, and the pharmacy down the street you are competing against? They cannot.


CVS also gets to muddy the waters with a lack of transparency. Here is what the lack of transparency gets you when you own the pharmacy, the insurance company and the PBM. Your pharmacy sets up a repackaging plant. They buy millions of some cheap generic product. They repackage that product and assign a new NDC (the code that tells you the manufacturer, the drug and the pack size) **and a new, much higher price.** The PBM makes that a preferred Tier 1 product, and pays the CVS pharmacy at the greatly inflated price. None of the other pharmacies can get this preferred NDC, and the non-preferred products barely pay anything, or are sold at a loss after DIR fees are accounted for. Who ultimately pays for this? Those people buying insurance from one of their subsidiaries do because premiums must be inflated. So when a state's insurance board looks at the insurance company's margin and allows them to increase premiums, the lack of transparency at retail and PBM hides those profits.


Why are these facts about CVS important, I thought we were talking about APhA, not CVS? **For those who were not aware, [the new President of APhA is a senior VP at CVS](https://www.linkedin.com/in/slealrx).** APhA issued a press release on December 17, 2021 stating: *APhA is engaging in direct conversations with chain pharmacy leadership and other influencers to address the issues related to workload and well-being.* When the President of the APhA is a senior VP for CVS, she would have to recuse herself from these talks as a matter of that being a huge conflict of interest.


Another tactic that has recently come to light deals with the proliferation of ""diploma mills"" that have popped up in the past 10 to 15 years. Why has APhA not taken a stand against these? If there were Medical School ""diploma mills"" opening up all over the US in order to flood the physician labor force with low-quality doctors, the AMA would launch something that looks like nuclear war against that. But the APhA has been silent. 


**A first year pharmacist shared this revelation: [I did not renew my APhA membership this year as it‚Äôs my first year out of school. But I came from a school in which paying for APhA membership every year was an unwritten requirement. You see, for a particular course we had every semester, it required ‚Äúservice hours‚Äù and they made it so that valid service hours came from only from organizations that required payment‚Ä¶.that never sat well with me but we really didn‚Äôt have any choice. Leadership told us we could try to create our own service events without going through APhA, but they‚Äôd have to be approved by the school and that would be ‚Äúvery difficult‚Äù. But because of this I know students who don‚Äôt agree with APhA but will renew just because they need the valid service hours to pass the curriculum.](https://www.reddit.com/r/pharmacy/comments/rix9y0/petition_to_remove_sandra_leal_as_president_of/hp0920i/)**


Oh wow! Did you read that?! No wonder the APhA turns a blind eye to ""diploma mills"". That user went on to say, ""I guess it never crossed my mind much because I assumed most pharmacy schools practically require memberships for students now.""


A follow up comment was, [""Wow so, pharmacy schools 'require membership' ‚Ä¶ so more students = more membership payments to APHA‚Ä¶ and we wonder why they never spoke up about Diploma mills ??? The whole thing is a racket ‚Ä¶. My God ‚Ä¶ and to think this is only the tip of the iceberg](https://www.reddit.com/r/pharmacy/comments/rix9y0/petition_to_remove_sandra_leal_as_president_of/hp0apx8/).


In the end, the APhA has not done much more than pay lip service to promoting the pharmacy profession. Over the past 15 years, not once have they fought for us like the AMA does for physicians. They were not even at the table when Part D and Obamacare were being hashed out. They turned a blind eye to what the PBMs have been doing to us since 2006-2007, which has progressively gotten worse year after year. They have been totally absent over the past decade when chains cut labor budgets to the point of now being a national emergency.

We need ALL pharmacists to advocate for our profession and more respect from the public**Please contact your local news to cover the 12/20 sick out. This will go nowhere without media attention and without a union to stand up until a negotiation for better pharmacy working conditions is agreed upon.**

I just called my local news station to tip off a reporter. **The public doesn't understand what we do as pharmacists or why our work is important to them.** They don't understand that horrible working conditions and years of staffing cuts and time pressures could kill them and their loved ones through a medication error. The public should care about this because it affects their health and their loved ones' health, but they don't yet know they should care about this and do not realize that this is a systemic issue and not just one-off mistakes that their pharmacists have made. **THIS IS WHERE AND WHY WE NEED LOCAL AND NATIONAL NEWS MEDIA TO HELP - SO THE PUBLIC KNOWS THEY ARE AT RISK AND CAN BACK US IN FIGHTING FOR SAFER WORK CONDITIONS.** Then we can have the time and staffing resources we need to do our jobs and to protect them from deadly medication errors.

The retail pharmacy chains and industry is marketing the exit of workers due to terrible working conditions like other big corporations - as a ""worker shortage"" to distract people [r/antiwork](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/) from truth, which is that the retail chains have been staffing with skeleton crews for years and putting the public's health at risk, esp. now with the increased demand for Covid vaccines and pharmacists leaving in droves because [r/pizzaisnotworking](https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzaisnotworking/) and pharmacists / techs realized the chains see them as expendable despite hailing them as ""healthcare heroes"" who are now providing 2/3rd of the nation's Covid vaccines to the public to help stem the spread of Covid. Also, despite raking in BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF PROFIT in recent quarters because of the Covid vaccination, they are still not increasing the number of staff pharmacists working or pay or adapting their metrics.

Everyone who reads this, please contact your local news. We need this to be on the front page so:

1. The public can recognize our importance as healthcare workers (still not consistent among the general public and likely your own store managers doesn't understand that you're an important healthcare worker who went to graduate school that was essentially medical school to earn a doctorate degree)
2. Retail chains can finally be called out for all the dangerous hours and staffing cuts they have done over the years
3. The ""worker shortage"" myth in pharmacy can be dispelled - just look at # of pharmacy grads vs. job openings pre-Covid and reporters will see that clearly there are plenty of workers
4. The public knows that retail chains are putting their health at risk by continuing to cut hours and push for performance metrics instead of creating more pharmacist openings and increasing staffing / pay rates for workers and essentially risking potentially harmful or even deadly medication errors as a ""cost of doing business""
5. The press can highlight how you can earn more working at a supermarket bakery or McDonald's than you can as a licensed pharmacy technician who has to do continuing education and pay fees to maintain their licenses
6. The press can highlight the culture of fear that retail chains have taken advantage of for years, with gag clauses to prevent talking to the media about working conditions, especially for most pharmacists in retail due to real threats of being fired and losing your income to support your families and pay back your loans. (This is because most retail pharmacists do not have residency training. Without residency training, most other non-retail chain employers won't even look at your resume or consider hiring you right now, esp. without inpatient or non-retail experience. In fact, I have seen job openings with descriptions that literally say, ""retail pharmacy experience does not count as experience for this \[managed care pharmacy\] job,"" so even if you have 20 years of experience as a licensed pharmacist, it counts for ZERO if you're in retail.)

EDIT: If you are afraid, it is OK. Tell the press you need to remain anonymous. Direct them to all the pharmacy subreddits you follow. Let the reporter see it is not just you and then find all of the articles over the years and last few months that have been about pharmacists getting fired or silenced by the chains when they have tried to do the right thing and bring the public's attention to this issue.

1503,Comment,hnmfflg,"I had a nurse who kept calling in prescriptions for phentermine for people. I didn‚Äôt suspect anything until one day she called and said she was the doctor. I guess she got her lies mixed up. The ‚Äúpatient‚Äù came in to pick up her prescription. I stalled her for fifteen minutes so that the cops could get there. Not only did they arrest the the person picking up, they found the nurse waiting in the car. 

Happy ending, you might think? Nope. About an hour later, an officer called me and said that the nurse told him that what she did wasn‚Äôt illegal because phentermine isn‚Äôt a controlled substance. I told him and that she was lying. He asked me if I was sure because he figured a nurse would know the law. ‚Ä¶ Uhh, what? It hadn‚Äôt crossed his mind yet that maybe, just maybe, she would lie to get out of trouble? And even if it wasn‚Äôt a controlled substance, it‚Äôs still illegal and unethical for her to be impersonating a doctor and calling in prescriptions without the doctor‚Äôs knowledge. I could hear the nurse in the background telling him that I didn‚Äôt know what I was talking about. 

He told me that he would do some more investigation and ended the call. The nurse‚Äôs name never showed up in the jail log or arrest records. 

A couple of weeks later, the same nurse phoned tried to phone in a Xanax prescription. I told her I wouldn‚Äôt be taking any more called in prescriptions from her and that another nurse or the doctor would need to call them in from now on. 

She asked me what my problem with her was. ? ? ? I told her the obvious. She said the police didn‚Äôt think she‚Äôd done anything wrong, so I had no right to refuse.  I told her good luck with all of that. She hung up on me. I never got another phoned in script from her. 

A year later she lost her license (shocker), and a couple of years after that, she OD‚Äôd and left young children behind.

Simply call out sick that morning and be a part of the cure! If you aren‚Äôt scheduled and they call you to come in, have an excuse handy and politely decline (please don‚Äôt be rude to your scheduler!)

Mention this post to as many of your coworkers as possible. 

The reasons for this being necessary are complex, but the main factor is that we need the government to recognize that we are essential to national security and therefore require a variable reimbursement rate scheme, where brick and mortar prescriptions are reimbursed at a higher rate than mail order, with guarantees that money goes directly to the pharmacy and not the PBM. Either that or lose your army of vaccinators. We will not tolerate these abysmal working conditions anymore. Most retail employees have worked in ‚ÄúBlack Friday‚Äù conditions for almost a full year now, we can‚Äôt make it another year- not even close. With Omicron on the horizon the time is now.

I told her yes because a lot of places are super short staffed right now especially with all the vaccines. She said thanks for the insight and understood the struggle.

But then I thought about all the locations saying they‚Äôre closing down days where there‚Äôs no pharmacists or they have no techs or they have extra pharmacist hours but no pharmacists to fill those shifts. My first offer with the Walgreens in my area (interned there for 4 years) was approximately $15-20 lower than most pharmacists who‚Äôs been there for 2+ years because Walgreens cut their incoming pharmacist pay recently. I left to go to a better company but not before they tried to tempt me with a manager position. My friend ended up taking that manager position and she is getting $14 less an hour than other managers who‚Äôs been there for 2+ working her butt off. She‚Äôs making $10 less than her staff pharmacist even.

My old coworkers are struggling mentally, physically, and financially, and some even applied to work at the same company as me because they see me doing much better. I don‚Äôt have the power to ‚Äúpoach‚Äù anyone but in the eyes of Walgreens people, I‚Äôm poaching their staff to come work with me.

The problem here isn‚Äôt short staff. The problem here is companies and management who make well above everyone else not willing to take care of its workers. Then they turn around and complain about how ‚Äúwe are short staffed people are leaving us‚Äù and ‚Äúsorry we have to close early because no pharmacist/tech is available to work.‚Äù No regards to WHY things are this way. Pharmacy schools are pumping out a lot of new pharmacists every year now, there should be no shortage if you pay and treat them decently. Technicians bust their butts every day but get paid barely above minimum wage in this economy where everything is inflated. And you wonder why people are leaving?

Is pharmacy short staffed and causing delays in care? Yes. Is there a shortage of people to work? Yes because you drove us out.

I feel bad for the people who have to wait a week for their blood pressure medication because of internal pharmacy issues. I feel bad to turn people away for vaccines because I‚Äôm so short staffed there‚Äôs no way I can take walk ins.

She also said the retail giant forced her to study for and take an immunization certification exam but did not compensate her for this off-the-clock work.

During her time as a Walmart pharmacist, Dr. Nikmanesh drew attention to noncompliance issues, claiming the pharmacy charged Medicare patients above the Medi-Cal reimbursement rate and did not provide eligible beneficiaries with their Medicare discounts. She also said Walmart did not report necessary data to the Controlled Substance Utilization Review and Evaluation System, which requires weekly reports to be filed with the state's justice department.

The lawsuit alleged her 2014 termination was a result of her bringing up these issues.

""In most surveys, pharmacists rank as the 2nd most trusted professionals in America. However, can you really trust an overworked pharmacist that is deprived the opportunity to take a break to recharge before attending to patients‚Äô needs, multiple doctor‚Äôs offices, and insurance companies, all while trying to stay within compliance of pharmacy laws and regulations?‚Äù Dr. Nikmanesh wrote in a¬†2015 piece¬†published about her lawsuit.

The court awarded Dr. Nikmanesh with $40,000 for economic losses, $100,000 for non-economic losses, $60,000 for future non-economic losses and $27.3 million in punitive damages.",2021-10-25,87

1599,Post,q07fih,"I physically can‚Äôt take pharmacy anymore.I need out. 

I‚Äôve hit my breaking point and I absolutely can‚Äôt do this anymore. Filling 800 a day through the week with 3 techs, giving 50-60 shots in an 8 hour shift, having 0 pharmacist overlap, customer attitudes and overall public perception of pharmacists, being hounded on metrics. It‚Äôs too much. Physically and mentally too much. 

I‚Äôve staffed and managed the busiest stores since the start of my career, but what is going on right now is completely untenable. The straw that finally broke my back happened this evening. After giving 75 shots in my 10 hour shift today in addition to god knows what all else we do, I leave work and head for a nearby local food joint with my wife for dinner since they were offering free appetizers to healthcare workers. I was informed as a retail pharmacist I was not eligible for the free app. I‚Äôm well aware of the problems pharmacists have had being identified as healthcare workers and this is nothing new. But today, it just hit harder. A lot harder. 

Myself, and many others just like me, have done more for this country in terms of healthcare than any other fucking profession. I‚Äôm not sugar coating it anymore. I help literally hundreds of patients every single day through this pandemic, while being at higher risk of public infection. I cover literally every step of healthcare other than putting my hands in your body and performing surgery. I (we) do it all. And I get nothing for it other than grumpy patients, grumpy corporate, no extra help, and no raises. Nothing. 

I know I haven‚Äôt said a single thing most of you don‚Äôt already know. But I needed to get it off my chest to a community of people who actually understand. Now for my request:

I need recommendations for jobs not in healthcare that can make about $25 an hour. It‚Äôs all I need to live the life I‚Äôve already been living for the last 11 years. Unfortunately I did the 2-4 path to pharmacy so I don‚Äôt have a degree in anything other than pharmacy. I wouldn‚Äôt be against jobs with on the job certifications where you get paid less while you‚Äôre learning. 

I can‚Äôt do anything in healthcare anymore that interacts with patients, it makes me sick to my stomach to even think about it.",2021-10-03,90

1601,Comment,hf6eu0c,"I TOTALLY understand all of this. My store used to be pristine. My pharmacy manager is the most anal guy you will ever meet, but is also one of the fastest pharmacists I‚Äôve ever worked with. We used to play fucking Uno after we filled everything for the day (500-800ish scripts on average) and would pause the game between pickups/calls. 

Then, 5 full time techs quit/retired/moved stores within a 5 month window, and nobody new has started since. Right in time for flu season! It‚Äôs awesome, I know, but it gets even better!

We are allowed 360 tech hours AND pharmacist overlap during the week, but guess what? We have literally 3 technicians on staff at my store, and I‚Äôm one of them. My boss has interviewed at least a dozen different  possible new hires, and only 2 are going to be starting soon (and that‚Äôs if they don‚Äôt quit after realizing what a shit show they are coming in to). When I clocked in this morning, we had 63 pages in QP. No, that‚Äôs not a typo. Covid testing is booked out for days, with a test every 10 minutes from 9am-1pm and from 2:45pm-5pm every single day. That means one of us has to be doing testing all day long, while whoever else is working that day (usually one pharmacist & HOPEFULLY two other technicians) do literally everything else. The phones never stop, the number of waiters has gotten up to 30 at a time, and there is always at least 1 in the queue all day long, so nothing besides waiters get filled. We have almost 800 non-C2 cycle counts that haven‚Äôt been touched in probably 2 months, and nearly 200 C2 cycle counts. Every other customer is mean and gets mad because their script has ‚Äúsaid it‚Äôs in process for four days and still isn‚Äôt filled‚Äù or because they ‚Äúsat on hold for 45 minutes and nobody would answer the phones‚Äù or they ‚Äúhad to wait a half hour for their script that was sent in 3 days ago.‚Äù 

That isn‚Äôt even all of it, but I‚Äôm sure you get the picture. I‚Äôm so burnt out‚Ä¶I can‚Äôt even explain how exhausted I am. Just know you are not alone in feeling the way you are feeling about healthcare/retail. Sorry to totally unload on you, but this kind of shit is just not okay.

1636,Comment,hd727ao,"It‚Äôs actually a problem with 3rd party contacts in general. Years ago, AWP was used as the price point for PBM contracts. Once generic medication began coming out, to gain market share manufacturers would inflate their AWP because pharmacies would order their generic over others to make a bigger spread

PBM caught on and started using things like MAC to offset these huge spreads.

Ultimately the problem lies with the rule ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt charge a cash payer less than you would charge a PBM‚Äù. Cash claims can be audited by any 3rd party and can be used to justify a chargeback on the pharmacy. GoodRX removes this problem for big corporations bc goodrx is processed using a bin, thus it is not auditable by other 3rd parties

I‚Äôm an independent owner who operates their own ‚Äúdiscount plan‚Äù with its own unique bin number to circumvent this. Big corporations can‚Äôt do this on scale across multiple states.

This sign is bullshit. Dental anesthetics will not kill you no matter how acutely high on meth a patient is. Now trying to sedate someone or put them under general anestheisa is a different story. And while a bigger pain in the ass for me and more dangerous than a non meth user, still probably won‚Äôt kill you. 

Think about all the meth users that end up in the hospital needing surgery. We put those people to sleep and the vast majority of the time they‚Äôre fine. 

On a technical level the problem is that meth causes a release of endogenous catecholamines. So patients who have recently used arrive deplete. Then you give them propofol or sevo of versed or whatever anesthetic and their BP tanks hard because they‚Äôve got nothing left to hold it up. We counter this by using direct acting alpha and beta agonists like phenylephrine or epi.  Sometimes we discover the meth use because of the exaggerated hypotension that is unresponsive to ephedrine (which normally works, in part, by causing the endogenous release of catecholamines).",2021-07-26,97

If you are an unemployed technician, please do NOT go work for a pharmacy that isn‚Äôt paying you a livable wage. For FAR too long these companies have been raking in BILLIONS of dollars at the expense of paying front line pharmacy techs scraps.

Being a pharmacy technician is literally a vocational/trade school curriculum. All other normal trades mid-career are netting 50k-70k annually (in states with strong Unions even 6-figures), meanwhile these recruiters want all the certifications and years of experience to pay you a measly $12-15/hr? Tell them to shove it!

This is the time now to be transparent about your pay. Big corps do not want that because if they can pay a new worker less than you, they will! The average pay isn‚Äôt where it should be because techs are not being transparent and fighting hard enough for better pay.

Don‚Äôt feel sorry for them because news flash; they can afford to pay your more!

Techs are literally the hands, legs and body of a pharmacy yet the head (pharmacist) is making 6-figures, and the tech doing all the lifting and grunt work is straddling the lower middle class line.

Meanwhile these companies require techs to do a bunch of training and have a significant medical/pharmacy knowledge base only to make less than a cashier at Trader Joe‚Äôs. It‚Äôs not making sense! At all!

The average pay for a pharmacy technician MINIMUM should be $25/hr ($52,000 yearly) in 2021.

Are you seeing how much these companies are ordering in product per year? Per DAY? Insane. Let‚Äôs not even talk about the amount of money in product they WASTE that could‚Äôve been used to better a technicians economic situation. You‚Äôve seen the waste!

Let‚Äôs be clear. Pharmacies NEED their technicians. With that need, they need to PAY UP! Technician work should be a stable and respectable job. Not this revolving door of who can get away with paying the least causing huge turnover rates.

You are a vile, disgusting company, and I firmly believe that you will not last through the 2030's. I can't wait to see you fail. The way you treat your employees coupled with your complete disregard for patient safety is going to be your ultimate downfall. Greed thy name is CVS.

1933,Post,lymlt2,"Burned out - I hate this careerFirst, let me start by stating I'm appreciative of my career and the decent income it has brought me and my family. There ARE fulfilling days, and I work for a company that has great benefits. For that, I am very grateful and appreciative. However, I am BURNED OUT and don't know whether to tough it up or try another career. My wife and I originally thought the issue was that I was working at a large chain that starts with a W, so I decided I needed to utilize the clinical skills a little more and moved over to a hospital. Maybe it's just the specialty I'm in, or the fact the patient care team/prescribing docs are all awesome, or the fact I see the same 4 or 5 prescriptions all day long, but I still wish I was doing something else.

Finished school and residency about 12 years ago. Decided I wanted to be a pharmacist because chemistry always interested me and somehow came easy to me in high school onwards. Seemed like a logical career path at the time. However, slowly but surely after residency I've gotten more and more disenchanted with the career, the long hours, and the fact I peaked salary wise 5 years ago. It has come to the point where not a week goes by where I don't feel like I could do a lot more with my life, and wish I went to school for something else. 

I know this sounds negative, but this is just how I feel:  a lot of times I ponder how much of my schooling I actually use day to day... it just feels like I print labels, count pills, answer a few questions (which would have been answered if they read the label or listened to the prescribing Doc/patient care team anyway), inevitably battle a few @$$h0l3s that don't understand what's taking so long, call a few old school doctors that still hand write their prescriptions that no one can read, then go home and do another 9-12 hours of the same thing the next day. If I died tomorrow, they'd be more than willing to hand over my job to a young and eager pharmacy grad that will work for $30-40k less and think they're striking it rich in this career.

Techs, if you're working extra, stay clocked in. Do it until your PDM* freaks out at you about overtime. And even then you can still probably sneak some hours in. Absolutely do not work for free for this garbage job that doesn't even remotely pay us appropriately for the amount of stress we go under and the service we provide to communities. Even if it's a favor to your coworkers, or even to yourself because then you'll have less work the next day, don't. Any short term benefit gained only harms you long term.

Pharmacists, go home and relax when your job is done. You work hard enough at work for the stress to follow you home.

Don't burn yourselves out, just take it one day at a time. Do what you can, and that's all you can do.

I was told off by another pharmacist for the same thing (when I was a student). And now as a pharmacist, I‚Äôm told off by my techs for wanting to eat or go to the toilet.

There have been so many incidents at my pharmacy where we fill 2-3 prescriptions that a patient doesn't *actually* need and they get angry because they paid x amount extra than they needed to and demand a refund due to our negligence. I literally have to baby each patient now and say ""I don't know which medications 'all of them' are so how about I read through what I've got and you say yes or no."" Sure enough each time there's about an average of three meds that they don't actually need. 

Do any of you handle this in a different way? It's so time consuming no matter which method we use - literally filling everything and the patient gets mad and demands reparations or reading off a list of 12+ meds and waiting for the patient to verify.

***EDIT*** ok here's what I've learned: I am booboo the fool for never having even considered that I could have the patient call back once they have their shit together.

2052,Post,kv3tpg,"Pharmacy, a thankless jobJust a quick rant here.  Excuse any typos or grammatical errors. 

I work in a hospital setting and as everyone is greatly affected by this pandemic, one thing I‚Äôve realized is that pharmacy is a thankless job. 

This past weekend I worked and I was the sole pharmacist. Typically our census with covid has been around 160-180 these past couple of months, but this weekend was ~200. Having to manage ALL of the patients in the hospital is quite tough when you consistently have calls from nursing (NOT blaming nursing here at all) why their meds haven‚Äôt been sent. 

Yesterday, we had a patient who was started on a levothyroxine drip as he was an organ donor. I had multiple calls from the ICU asking where their medications were. I had to repeatedly ask ‚ÄúI tubed it half an hour ago, have you checked the tube station?‚Äù. The nurse said ‚ÄúNo, I didn‚Äôt. I see it now though!‚Äù

Physicians, RTs, and RNs are always calling about their patients, but they don‚Äôt realize that the pharmacy is managing the whole hospital. 

I love my job, but I am exhausted from working. I am tired of getting nasty calls asking why medications are late when the order was JUST put in or why things are not verified ASAP. 

Sometimes the queue is long. Sometimes I‚Äôm answering phone calls. Sometimes I‚Äôm checking IVs. Sometimes I‚Äôm answering the window. Sometimes I‚Äôm in the narcotic vault. Sometimes I‚Äôm dispensing medications if my tech isn‚Äôt around. 

I just wish others would understand we have a lot going on and are doing our best to manage patient care safely.",2021-01-11,120

Now it seems like it‚Äôs a daily happening.
In the span of 2 hours (9-11am) at my local independent pharmacy...

A nurse from a cardiologists office berates me because her patient waited until they were out of medication to call for a refill.  Apparently she feels it‚Äôs my job to tell her patient to plan better. Then it is also my job to tell her patient she needs an office visit. The patients is 85 years old and told me ‚Äúforget it‚Äù she doesn‚Äôt want to take her Losartan anyway.

A ‚Äúgentleman‚Äù called in for a refill of Lantus, also out of medication, also no refills.  The MD refuses the refill because the patient hasn‚Äôt been seen since 2019.  Again, it becomes my job to tell the patient he needs an appointment.  This leads to a 10 minute tirade on the part of the ‚Äúgentleman‚Äù which actually borders on verbal abuse. Sir, I‚Äôm just the messenger. 

A woman‚Äôs Brilinta copay is $150 a month supply.  She‚Äôs ‚Äútired of being ripped off‚Äù at this pharmacy that is ‚Äúonly out to make money off of old people‚Äù. Ma‚Äôam, your insurance sets your copay.

A man calls because his mail order has been lost/stolen/forgotten and he is out of levothyroxine. He has never filled this RX at my pharmacy but ‚Äúc‚Äômon, just put 5 or 6 in this old vial from the mail order to hold me over‚Äù. More verbal abuse when I say no.

A 45 year old man let‚Äôs me have it because his Adderall is too soon to fill and he‚Äôs tired of my ‚Äúbullshit‚Äù‚Äòrules about early refills.

I was working an 11 hour shift and was completely exhausted by the second hour.
Luckily things got better as the day went along.
But it‚Äôs discouraging that people are so angry and mean.  I actually like my job a lot and for the most part can brush these things off but yesterday really got to me.  When I started (in the early 90s) patients were not so quick to be mean.  Nowadays, it seems like they start nasty and ratchet up the hostility from there.

On top of that 2 of my elderly patients died of Covid in the last week and one is on a vent in the ICU.

Thanks for the space to vent!

We‚Äôve known a vaccine was coming for some time so you‚Äôd think they‚Äôd have put a viable plan in place. But no, the corporate overlords just expect us to be jumping up and down to fill in the gaps in the clinic schedules that they‚Äôve created when we‚Äôre already short staffed on pharmacists and techs to keep the stores open. 

I was TOLD, not ASKED, to give up a tech for a clinic that‚Äôs not even close to my store‚Äôs location when I barely have the staff to stay functional as is. And then I was asked myself to give up a day off to go work at a clinic which would put me at 8 days in a row over the holidays when I‚Äôm already missing out on spending time with my family - just the ones in my house, not even the extended family that has been trying to safely get together in small groups just to remind each other that we still exist. Yeah, I can‚Äôt be a part of that because I don‚Äôt want to kill my grandparents. 

I looked at the clinic schedule for my area and there are multiple clinics scheduled on the same days for a couple of weeks in a row. I know that this is a valuable public health initiative and it‚Äôs important to get people protected, but wouldn‚Äôt it have MAYBE been a good idea to make sure there‚Äôs actually a team in place to handle just one clinic a day before setting up several clinics and not being able to deliver? There‚Äôs pharmacists and techs who are out sick with COVID themselves - did they think we‚Äôre immune? Did firing a bunch of people in the middle of the pandemic backfire on you, oh corporate gods? Forgive me if my chronic dry eye from staring at a computer screen all day doesn‚Äôt allow me to shed a tear. 

I think mostly I just hate the attempted guilt trip. I already work over 40 hours a week so forgive me if that premium pay - which still doesn‚Äôt come close to time and a half - doesn‚Äôt sound all that appealing. Doubling my hourly rate might make me consider it, but even then I think you‚Äôre overestimating how much that combined with a pat on the back from my superiors would mean to me. No, I don‚Äôt care if you put me up in the local roach motel as a concession. I‚Äôd rather be present with my family and miss out on being the unsung hero of the attempt to end the pandemic.

2123,Post,kbo1zr,"CVS and COVID positionsI thought I would share what was on my mind. I was a retail pharmacist at CVS for about twelve years (2005-2017). I saved and was able to take an early retirement at 38. I hated my time there and vowed to never return.

Fast forward to a few days ago when I saw that CVS was hiring thousands to help assist with vaccinations. I felt a civic duty to apply and help with the process. I did so and was rejected less than 24 hours later. Secretly, I did not even want to be paid. I was going to donate my salary. Since I left, my investments have made far more than I ever would have earned as a pharmacist.

The position, along with about 50 others, are still there in my area. I know that CVS had a strict no re-hire policy around that time. I also know that management at the time found me to be difficult to manage because I was very honest and objective about what was going on in pharmacy world with opiates, metrics, etc. But they're facing a shortage of epic proportions to get these vaccines going.

I just find it hard to believe that given the position they're in, I would have been turned down like that. I've signed up to volunteer on the state board COVID page if I'm needed anywhere. I certainly don't feel the guilt of staying home and sitting this out anymore. Anyways, I just thought I'd share. Feedback appreciated.",2020-12-12,124

A few days ago I had to counsel a patient who I knew would have an obnoxious attitude based on the triage notes, which included some very colorful and entertaining direct quotes. So I put my game face on and headed to the ER. 

I found the patient laying in his bed, introduced myself and counseled him on his antibiotic. He wouldn‚Äôt make eye contact or even acknowledge me, until I finished and asked ‚Äúdo you have any questions?‚Äù Suddenly he propped himself up on his elbows, looked me straight in the eye and said ‚ÄúYeah, you got a husband or what?‚Äù

You all know how this happens all the goddamn time and it‚Äôs annoying as hell, and up until that day I would usually just timidly smile and say something polite to re-direct the creeps.

2202,Comment,gc89u7g,"That ""obviously sick patient"" isn't acting inappropriately because he's sick, so your response was professional, proportional, and appropriate.  There's nothing to feel bad or guilty about here, I'm proud of you.

The closest thing I've done to this was at the pickup window in my outpatient pharmacy.  I could hear a woman verbally berating my (soft-spoken) coworker at the window next to mine.  I leaned over and said firmly, ""Ma'am, do not talk to my colleague in that tone.  We are doing the best we can to help you.""  She actually changed her tune pretty quickly, which I found surprising.",2020-11-14,127
2203,Comment,gc8ec4w,"I hate the fact that people can be the most horrible, evil person their entire lives but when they die or something bad happens to them everyone is supposed to be respectful and act like they weren‚Äôt terrible. 

Being sick is not an excuse to act like that. I had an abx resistant infection a few years back that put me in the hospital at 3am. I hadn‚Äôt slept in days, I was in the most excruciating discomfort I‚Äôd ever felt, I was being run through test after test to make sure it was in fact an infection and not my organs shutting down. It was the lowest I‚Äôve ever been, and when an insanely attractive nurse walked in and started taking my vitals, I didn‚Äôt hit on her. In my sleep deprived, delirious state where I managed to convince myself that I was going to marry this girl that walked in 30 seconds ago, I still had enough control over myself not to be a creep. Because that‚Äôs not what normal people do when they get sick. It‚Äôs like when people say drinking doesn‚Äôt bring out a different person, it brings out what‚Äôs already inside.

2252,Post,jfy5pw,"I was caught diverting Adderall from my retail pharmacy; I've been clean and sober from any mood-altering substances for 18 months now and got hired as a pharmacist again. AMA I was caught diverting Adderall from my place of employment in the early part of 2019. I had been prescribed Adderall from my doctor for about 5 years. My doc retired in November of 2018. At the time, I wanted to get off the Adderall because I didn't like how it effected my mood and sleep. And because I felt like I couldn't manage my use of it; i.e. my 30-day script would never last 30 days. So when my doctor retired, I decided that was the time to get off the stuff. I had a drinking problem as well prior to this time; my last drink was in June of 2018, so I was looking forward to living a completely drug and alcohol free lifestyle without the Adderall or booze. My addictions were effecting my marriage, my physical health, mental health... basically everything was worse because of my use.

I got my last prescription filled and started to slowly titrate my dose downward. After tapering down my Adderall dose, I was finally off the stuff, I thought. The next 2 weeks were absolutely brutal. Withdrawal was bad. I had no energy at all, and all I wanted to do was sleep. I could barely function at work. And I mean *barely* function. It sucked. At the time, I was kind of pissed because I didn't think the physical withdrawal symptoms would last that long. After suffering through two weeks of withdrawal, I decided this wasn't the answer and scheduled an appointment with a new doctor. When I met with him, I was honest and said my goal was to get off the Adderall but I couldn't function without it. His solution was to start me on Wellbutrin and hope things would improve. He wouldn't prescribe me Adderall. I was not thrilled but figured I try the Wellbutrin. After a week of being on the Wellbutrin, nothing changed. I still felt like shit every day. So I went back to the new doc and told him so. His response was that the Wellbutrin could take a couple weeks to really start working, and again denied my request to start back on a low dose of Adderall. At this point, I'm exhausted. Absolutely exhausted. So a few days later, I say fuck it, and start taking a couple Adderall here and there from the pharmacy and altering the on-hand quantities in the computer.

I'll spare the details of the next couple months, but eventually I was arrested after closing the pharmacy one night. I went to rehab the next day and stayed there for 57 days. I've been sober from any mood-altering substances since the day of arrest and am employed again as a part-time pharmacist at a hospital.

I wanted to share my story because I know there are other people out there struggling with addiction. Healthcare professionals are not immune to drug addiction. Statistics show that we are just as likely to develop substance use disorder as the next guy. If you are struggling with addiction and are looking for help or resources, send me a message. For everyone else, feel free to ask me any questions you'd like. I'm actually going to shadow a physician assistant today because I'm considering going back to school to become a PA to work in addiction medicine. I'll try to answer any questions tonight when I get back home.

Update (2/4/21): After multiple interviews and discussions with the District Manager (and months and months of working on my recovery, my mental health, physical health and self confidence), I was hired into another part-time job!  Working at a small grocery chain retail pharmacy.  Been there a couple weeks and it seems to be a great gig so far.  Tech staffing is sufficient and we fill about 100 scripts/day and the hours are ideal, IMO.  Still working toward applying to PA school.  As time goes by, I‚Äôm more and more certain that I want to open my own practice and specialize in addiction and mental health.  Pharmacy is a great profession but I feel like my purpose is to help others who are going through a similar experience I did.

Update (7/8/21): I‚Äôve completed 4 pre-requisite courses in order to apply to PA school (Microbiology: A, Anatomy & Physiology: A, Developmental Psychology: A, Pathophysiology: A-).  Two other classes in progress.  Submitted my application today to Central Michigan University.  Expecting to get interviewed for a spot in the program some time in September.  Might be starting PA school in May 2022?  We shall see.

Update (1/16/22): Finished my pre-requisite classes with a 3.95.  Was given an interview in October and accepted into PA school the next week.  I spoke openly about my past during the interview process and I think that helped me more than hurt me.  Looking forward to starting PA school and hope to be able to start helping others in addiction soon. üòÅ",2020-10-22,130

2303,Comment,g6e648h,"Back when I was a resident, part of my job was to go to the dinners the pharmaceutical reps (we called them ""drug dealers"") put on for the hem/onc nurses.  My job was to review all the evidence in advance, and at the end of their presentation, raise my hand and ask embarrassing questions to poke holes in their finely crafted message.  The ability to make wildly liberal use of the open bar was a nice perk.

Alas, now I practice in a state where I can't even take a pen from a drug dealer, much less a steak dinner.

But there's a reason the drug dealers give gifts to pharmacists (and doctors and nurses).  It's because they work.  If their freebies didn't sway our knowledge, recommendations, or our comfort in dispensing their product, they wouldn't be giving us this stuff.",2020-09-24,133

This job has aged me 15 years in 5 and I don't have any sort of plan B. 60-80 hour weeks to keep the ship running have become my new normal. I just can't anymore and don't want to anymore . Crippling depression has hit me harder than our 4000 flu shot quota. 

I don't know how to escape from this. For all I know I'm already dead and made it the the 5th level of hell: stuck enternally  explaining prior authorizations to middle aged Karen's bitching that their insurance won't cover Latisse. I am going to freak the fuck out on the next person I have to do this with. 

Scammers call us 3-5 times a day trying to make us give out patients insurance information. Asking them to stop calling doesn't deter them , hanging up doesn't deter them, arguing doesn't deter them . They are preying on Medicaid patients because it's easiest for them to bill out I suppose . 

Not even going to use my alt account here . Retail pharmacy is going to kill me someway or another .

I used to work full time retail and had thoughts of leaving the profession, Overstress, hating my job, never having a single day of looking forward to work. I always thought I didn't like community (which was true as a student), and would have liked Hospital pharmacy. 
Then, my husband got some job stability and encouraged me to pursue my passion in Hospital.  I went down to part time to focus on that, and HOLY SHIT that made a world of difference. I actually started to enjoy the retail job?! At least, I enjoyed it significantly more than before. 

It made me realize I didn't hate my job, I just needed a better work/life balance. And this was just from 40 hours a week. Working 60-80 hours a week like yourself, in any high stress job, would make a sane person feel overwhelmed and want to quit.

For those who need convincing, I am brutally honest. I tell them that we expect COVID-19 will be back in NYC this winter. And if COVID-19 is active and they get any other vaccine-preventable illness like influenza or pneumococcal pneumonia, they will face the (previously unthinkable) catch 22: stay home, unsafe and untreated, and pray they survive without medical assistance, or present to the ED, and risk catching COVID on top of whatever else is killing them. 

Feel no guilt about scaring the shit out of any patients you are counseling on the benefits of accepting vaccines -- even if it is just this year.

She then said ‚Äúwhat? Why is that offensive? YOU ARE!?‚Äù I again told her to leave. I refused to fill her RX and gave her scripts back. I told her there are other pharmacies that can fill for her but she is banned and not welcomed in the store.

Some can even be unfairly shunned out of the profession if they seek help. This is inexcusable, which is why I'm determined to become part of the solution.  I‚Äôm currently trying to find out how to improve the psychological well being of our healthcare professionals.

1. What are the biggest issues you‚Äôre dealing with emotionally and mentally?
2. What difficult situations do you wish you could be at your best in? By best I mean either unphased, appreciative, happy, calm, not overthinking, focused.

2388,Comment,fz0aid3,"I'm the RXM at a chain so my answers may differ from staff pharmacists and techs. My number 1 cause of stress is the decrease in hours from corporate for our tech budget and increasing RX volume, metrics to follow, and increased demand for making calls to patients. The decreased labor budget leads to things not getting done and further problems downhill. 

Emotionally, I would say that a lot of pharmacists will say burnout and depersonalization affect them. Everything falls on the RPh shoulders during the shift, so we become paranoid about little things we may have missed while struggling to keep up with scripts. I used to be very enthusiastic about going to work but over the last 2 years, I am a completely different person, becoming anxious on the drive to work, trying to maintain composure when a tech asks me the same question or to how to resolve a simple insurance issue.

Another article about more mistakes happening in retail pharmacies. I've had family members be given the wrong medications. There are customers coming in or calling most every day complaining about mistakes. I'm sure everything in this article sounds familiar to all of you working in retail pharmacies, it's definitely familiar to me. 

It's dangerous for the patients and dangerous for the mental health of all of us working in pharmacies in these situations in already difficult times. The pharmacy I work at being understaffed adds more stress for everyone involved and these companies still don't care even when these mistakes could have killed someone. They keep denying it's a problem. I feel helpless. The stress this has been putting on me makes me want to quit, but I know that would put more stress on my coworkers. I've seen many posts here about people quiting because of the stress and chaos of retail pharmacies. 

We need to do something about this, but nothing is going to change if we don't all speak up. We need to make these big companies give us the hours we need so we don't fall behind even more.

2444,Post,hkn4b4,"Got to witness yet another ‚Äúinteresting‚Äù incident at the pharmacy todaySo about 2 hours ago I was at my local independent pharmacy that‚Äôs in a multi story building and services all the doctors offices in that building. Within the last couple days, my state (Texas) just introduced a mandatory mask order for businesses and indoor/outdoor gatherings of 10 or more. As you can imagine, a pharmacy surrounded by doctors offices have been requiring a mask to enter the pharmacy since March. There are signs stating this on the main building entrances, the elevator, the pharmacy doors, the doors to every doctors office...etc. And to accommodate people the pharmacy has even implemented a ‚Äúcurb-side‚Äù delivery of the Rx‚Äôs on top of expanding their delivery times and waiving their usually delivery fee. Quite kind of them to do all of that in my mind... oh also, the pharmacy door is locking with someone just sitting beside it so they can verify you have a mask and are wearing it before coming inside and to take your info if you don‚Äôt so they can still get you your scripts. 

Anyway, this guy (who will be called ‚ÄúMr Shitstain‚Äù) who seemed to be in his late 40‚Äôs / early 50‚Äôs not wearing a mask (side note: he had that red MAGA hat on. Do what you will with that detail) is standing at the door knocking right as I get out of the elevator. When the young lady (tech in training) unlocks the door and says they require a mask to come inside unless he wanted to give his info and wait in the hallway. 

This guy straight up lost his shit! Told her things like (and I WISH I were making this up to farm karma) ‚ÄúNo woman is gonna tell me what I can and can‚Äôt do‚Äù ‚ÄúI have a constitutional right to not wear a mask‚Äù, ‚Äúmaybe if you weren‚Äôt such a big pharma sheep you‚Äôd have learned that wearing a mask is fatal because of CO2‚Äù, ‚Äúyou better get me a male pharmacist out here right now! I swear to god you‚Äôre getting fired today!‚Äù  

So tech in training tries to say that she‚Äôs not going to help him if he keeps talking to her that way, but he cuts her off telling her to shut up and do what she was told. 

Well, Mr Shitstain got his wish. The pharmacist came out, asked the guy what the issue was AND even let him rant. After Mr Shitstain finished up the pharmacist made it clear that the guy was banned from the pharmacy, that they‚Äôd transfer his Rx‚Äôs out to another pharmacy anytime after 4pm today (I‚Äôll elaborate below) and that the doctor who wrote his scripts would be called and advised of his abusive behavior toward his staff and customers. When Mr Shitstain, tried to argue some more, the pharmacist told him to take his sexist views elsewhere and walked away like a boss! This made the rest of us have to wait in the hallway for about 10 minutes before he walked away and the tech unlocked the door for us (which got us all a free soda, so WIN for me!) 

Now, according to Mr. Shitstain 2 of his scripts were for controls. As you are no doubt aware, when you do what he did, most pharmacy people will screw you over any way they can with the rules on controls. Apparently, if Shitstain is to be believed the scripts aren‚Äôt due until tomorrow. This pharmacy is closed on weekends, but even if they weren‚Äôt it‚Äôs July 4th so he‚Äôs screwed regardless. That‚Äôs why they wouldn‚Äôt transfer out until after 4. (I‚Äôm guessing the controls weren‚Äôt C2‚Äôs since they didn‚Äôt say transfers weren‚Äôt allowed but maybe they were just leaving details out because other people were nearby?) 

The other part is when the doctors in this building find out a patient is being refused service, they‚Äôre basically cut off when it comes to controls and are forced into an office visit to discuss the incident and expectations demanded of patients. So this guy screwed himself in basically every way short of being arrested. 

I can‚Äôt emphasize enough how good this pharmacy is. Even when COVID wasn‚Äôt a thing. They‚Äôre AMAZING! And this guy just showed the absolute worst a person can be and proverbially spit in their faces. But I‚Äôm sure this isn‚Äôt surprising to you all. 

In any event, I thought y‚Äôall might enjoy getting to live vicariously through the PharmD telling the Shitstain to piss off. Try not to work too hard today and enjoy your July 4th holiday weekend!

Physically I'm doing ok. I work out a lot, have good diet, and I have plenty of energy throughout the day. But mentally/emotionally, I feel like a shell of my former self. It's like I'm hollow now...a piece of my soul is missing.

I just don't care about anything anymore. All I do is work, and most of my extra money goes into my loan which I am still paying off. When I'm not at work, I still have tons of anxiety and stress from work. There really isn't any joy in my life at all. Physically I feel fine, but mentally/emotionally I feel completely exhausted all the time. 

I can still show up and do my job, and even perform well. But I feel completely dead inside. Like nothing I do really matters, and all I'm doing is wasting my life away in a soul-crushing job for no real reason at all...except that I don't see any other choice.",2020-07-03,142

2460,Post,hg3f7n,"Pharmacy school lied to meI apologize for the ranting, but I needed to vent.  

I remember being told how we were becoming members of the""most trusted profession"".  That we are an important part of a multidisciplinary healthcare team.  That we would soon have prescribing authority. (Some states do, but I anticipated this to be in more by now.). That we would be making more clinical decisions and influencing patient care.  

Having worked as a technician, intern, pharmacist, and pharmacy manager over the last 18 or so years, I feel like I was lied to. My job values my ability to stand for extended periods of time as much as my pharmaceutical knowledge.  This is evident in the fact that no medical restrictions that require sitting are everallowed, including broken bones and pregnancy.  I am asked more questions about the location of OTC items, GoodRx prices, and our hours than anything even remotely pertaining to medicine.  Mandatory counseling is a joke when people don't care or want to listen to what you have to say. I'm responsible for dispensing pet medications even though I was never trained in veterinary medicine and am lucky to know the animal type much less the breed.  Pharmacy staff is disrespected repeatedly on a daily basis.  We are asked not to complain or vent by managers because it creates a negative work environment.  We are expected to be the gate-keepers of controlled substances by checking the PMP before filling prescriptions, but doctors are not required to do so before writing for them. 

 It's our fault you have no insurance and your doctor put you on the latest most expensive rebranding of an old drug. It's our fault your copay is higher than the GoodRx price. It's our fault Medicare requires us to collect a ton of info to fill your test strips and limits how many you can get.  

I guess after so many years of being beaten down I have just forgotten what it's like to actually make a difference in someone's life. To make that connection where you really helped someone. And I don't mean finding a manufacturer coupon online. I mean actually talking to a patient about a concern, analyzing their drug list, discussing alternative treatment options with a doctor (who will actually speak to you in person and listen), and genuinely help a person feel better.  You know, what we went to school for Every job was supposed to be clinical by now.  I feel like this interaction would happen occassionally , but that now it's been years. We're all working with less help, more volume,, more metrics. Sure we may be contacting people to push adherence and vaccines, but it's more numbers. We are not rewarded for the quality of our interactions, just the quantity.

 This job is not what I was trained for and this profession is the joke of the healthcare ""team"". We are the fat kid picked last.  We are the Gary/Jerry of Parks and Rec.  Paid off my student loans and looking for the new career path until I can retire.  I think Pharmacy and I may have irreconcilable differences.

Edit: I am speaking from a retail pharmacy perspective. I have looked for jobs in other aspects of pharmacy such as hospital or long term care. The market in my area is saturated and many of the more clinical positions require or at least prefer a residency.  I've applied for PRN at hospitals, but I feel like all employers see on my resume is retail for so long that they assume I can't do anything else.  I've applied to do prior authorizations with insurance companies and they specifically say that retail does not count as experience in this department.  I'm going for a masters in informatics currently, so hopefully that will open some doors in the future.",2020-06-26,143
2461,Comment,fw1oght,"I recently had to pick up some medication for my unwell cat from a human pharmacy. Prior to that, I didn't even know that was a thing people do.

I know pharmacists aren't vets but I was almost overwhelmed with gratitude at how much help the pharmacist offered me. The script that the vet's office had faxed hadn't arrived. The vet's office kept promising it was sent but it has been a few hours and my cat really needed the puffers. The pharmacist agreed to look at the copy I had on my phone to get everything ready for me so I could grab and go when the script came through.

It turns out that there were issues with all four meds my cat had been prescribed. The doses ordered for the puffers aren't available in Canada and the two portal meds weren't in stock. We still couldn't reach the vet. She called like four times between other customers.  She actually wrote me a list of available doses for the puffers and (with the disclaimer that she knows nothing about cats) what she would recommend instead of oral terbutaline (only available as a turbohaler). I brought the note back to the vet and they finally called back to the pharmacy. They took all of her recommendations. 


She also gave her best effort on counseling me on my cats meds despite, once again, her telling me she knows nothing really about cats (but she was willing to bet that Flovent can give them thrush). My actual vet office gave me zero counseling, even when asked. 

I know you're probably not the pharmacist I delt with that day (since I'm in Canada) but I can't describe how grateful I was to her. I was pretty stressed out and I have a rather flat affect so I don't know if she realized how much I appreciated her efforts. ANYWAY, what I'm trying to say is, I'm sure you make a big difference to more people than you know. Us, the general public, are just really bad at showing appreciation.

I cannot stress this enough --- Your corporate office does not give a FUCK!!! 

Read that again. 

It's not even proactive at this point, you should've requested this weeks ago. 

The vast majority of drugstore type chains (CVS, Walgreens, Rite Aid etc) will never close the inside of the store because sales are currently booming! We're one of the few businesses making an absolute killing right now. Even though you're sold out of everything the people are looking for (thermometers, hand sanitizer, fucking aloe and toilet paper) they want to keep driving traffic through the store so people will buy up the other useless shit sitting on the shelves. 

Many of us have asked our DMs (who get the final say) about switching to curbside/drive thru-only only to have been flat out denied. Myself and my colleagues have been told the reason is literally because we still need to drive traffic through the stores to increase business revenue. Go ahead and ask corporate, they'll tell you like they told us, 'It's up to your DM'.

From Monday we decided to lock the front door. Now we make people queue outside and only let them in if they're paying by card and have no symptoms.

One of my new tech typed it in, i caught it and called him asking for diagnosis code. 

He started out saying his wife has asthma and needed it for prophylaxis. I asked ‚Äúprophylaxis for?‚Äù.  The stuttering and panic settled in and all he could mutter was ‚Äúfor prevention‚Äù. 

I gave him a chance and let him know that whatever he says will be reported word-for-word to the medical board.

I then asked if his wife has Rheumatoid Arthritis, Lupus, or tested positive for COVID19, he denied. At this point I explained that this combo should specifically be used for positively tested COVID19 patients with moderate to severe symptoms as an add on therapy (which I am not convinced as a result of one single weak scientific study).

Check this, he DOUBLE DOWN by saying ‚Äúoh we‚Äôre traveling soon and needing it for traveler‚Äôs prophylaxis!!!‚Äù

Then I asked his reasoning for the 30 tablets of azithromycin 250mg, he said ‚Äúhold on‚Äù. (Pretty sure he‚Äôs checking dosing guideline for traveler‚Äôs diarrhea at this point). 

He went back on the phone 10 seconds later and said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs for traveler‚Äôs diarrhea‚Äù. I gave myself a pat on the back for knowing exactly what he was gonna say. Was gonna remind him the Rx he called in is not the correct dosing for traveler‚Äôs diarrhea. But that was all I needed, and said thank you for his time.

Case 2) A podiatrist called in for same combo with fewer quantity. I wasn‚Äôt there and one of our floater filled it. Open and shut case here after a short conversation.

Case 3) A PA gave me a prescription for herself, I asked if her supervising physician is informed of her self-prescribing practice. I gave her a pass because she actually said sorry and knew what she‚Äôs doing is wrong since this should be reserved for the intended patients due to its shortage.

I touched the Rx, looked at it, confirmed yes this is the same. He said ok and left.
Hours later he returns, I help him again. He says he wants to get these Rx filled for his mom (still he is carrying the inhaler). I take four prescriptions from him, the last is for hydroxychloroquine. It's from a local hospital. I asked if she is covid positive. He says yes. I ask if he has been in contact with her. He says, she got home from the hospital this morning. yes I live with her.

I told him he shouldn't be in the store tell him to leave and come back through the drive thru in 30 min. I fill all his Rx...meanwhile the front store manager tries to Lysol all the front store products he touched. The poor sweet cashier up front rang him up without the six foot barrier because they only have one table barrier in the store and it's for pharmacy.

I called the hospital to confirm yes it was covid 19 positive. No they did not test family members. No they did not tell family members to self quarantine, yes they did think handing them PAPER prescriptions and not warning the pharmacy before hand was the best thing to do.

I will be having my techs start answering the phone and reminding each customer we recommend use of the drive thru. We will take requests for OTC items and will be sanitizing the clip board between each customer. We will be doing this until I can convince my supervisor that it is in the community‚Äôs best interest to close down the front doors. 

Pharmacies are going to be one of the worst offenders of disease transmission to our highest risk patients. We tried to leave out Lysol wipes for the card readers and hand sanitizers but twice now they have been stolen. We have several suspected cases in our area but not enough testing kits.. all suspected cases were denied testing. Therefore the community is still at ease with no confirmed cases. 

Contact your supervisors and let them know this is what other pharmacies are doing NOW before we have confirmed cases. This can only work if it implemented before it is too late. 

How will CVS, Walgreens, Walmart, etc like to be in the news when a pharmacist tests positive and transmitted it to their community of hundreds or thousands? Let‚Äôs get ahead of it. 

Implement hand washing protocols and encourage techs to stay home if ill.

The pharmacist went back to verifying, but were clearly flustered for several minutes after.

On another day, a staff pharmacists answered the phone. *Blah blah blah*. They asked for a DOB. The patient tried to be cute as well. The only thing I heard was ""okay, when you have all your information feel free to call back"" <CLICK> and went  back to verifying as if nothing had happened.

Our patients are the product of a system where they do not have regular access to a doctor they know and trust. They are LEGITIMATELY afraid of going bankrupt if they go to a hospital. They get skeptical about genuine medical advice because it comes with a ridiculous price tag that they SHOULD resent.

And now, they don't even have a competent executive branch of the government to calm them, inform them, and protect them during what is frankly a pretty serious threat to their health, the health of their community, and has already kicked most Americans' financial security right in the ballsack.

Around the time when Shingrix came out and was on backorder indefinitely (so early 2018), I made sure to prioritize him as he‚Äôs an elderly patient with comorbidities and I saved a dose just for him.

2808,Post,f8w38s,"In Response to the Recent NYT Articles...I am a technician of 8 years who has worked for both CVS and Walgreens. I now work for an independent. 

These recent NYT articles that have shone light on the behind the scenes actions of CVS and WAG have been an eye opener for a lot of the state boards, causing mayhem country wide. 

Here is my story:

I was with CVS for 6 years , 3 of which were part time, not because i wanted to be part time but because no one had the hours  to hire me on full time. I ended up driving almost an hour commute one way to make less than $11 an hour simply so i could have full time benefits, health insurance, etc; 

I finally found a home store , and was hired on as inventory specialist, which came with no pay raise. Even though, when loss prevention came in to look at our expired drug logs and how many drugs were being listed as ""damaged"" each year, they came to me. I once lost  us 10 points on an LP audit because i was missing one single report in my binder. A whole lot of responsibility for not a whole lot of pay. The stress of this job alone sent me into emotional overdrive. Eventually i landed myself in a psychiatric unit  for 5 days due to the stress of not only my job but also not making enough money (working full time) to make ends meet comfortably. I asked for raises but i think the most i ever got was 30 cents. I am nationally certified.  In 2018 my PIC announced she was leaving and that was my signal to go, my manager was the only thing making the job semi worth it. 

I then left for walgreens, I hadnt been there 3 months before the words ""budget cuts"" started to reach my ears, despite the upcoming rite aid buy out. Within 4 months they had me training the new employees we had absorbed from rite aid and sending me all over the state to train and instruct the rite aids that had been converted to walgreens. The money was better, but it was still retail.  Surveys became the sole focus, a system was implemented to track the amount of errors a technician or pharmacist made, too many ""dings"" and you were fired, no questions asked. I was then placed in a store doing over 1000 a day with 2 pharmacists and 5 techs.  The money wasnt worth it, i was losing my mind with stress and i was slowly watching pharmacists and techs a like quit, even taking jobs with significant pay cuts simply to get away from the stress. 

The common areas between the two companies are this:

Surveys and customer satisfaction take precedence over accuracy. 

Speed also takes precedence over accuracy, both companies kept a metric of how many scripts each pharmacist could check per hour.

While walgreens was better, the pay was terrible for what we were dealing with. Yearly raises were offered but i never received more than 50 cents per year at either company.

Employees dont matter. Pharmacists and techs both are victim to overly strenuous metrics that are nearly impossible to meet, how many rewards cards did you scan, how many care passes did you enroll, how many patients agreed to get their refills, how many flu shots did you run,etc;

I was able to escape to an independent lab, where i am no longer customer facing.

I can honestly say both chain companies had an affect on my over all mental health. 

I have played witness to misfills, several of which could have harmed the patient, two of which were for children. 

The public isnt safe using these pharmacies. A properly working pharmacy includes being properly staffed and trained, something of which both companies struggled with. 

Lets continue the fight against PBMs, and against placing the public at risk. 

I just wanted to get my experiences out there. 

TL/DR; CVS and WAG are both awful. Speed and metric scores are valued over accuracy.",2020-02-24,159

I got INCREDIBLY lucky and escaped corporate retail pharmacy, and I will never work for a corporate pharmacy in any capacity ever again. If it comes to a point where those are my only job choices, I will change my profession entirely. Being a corporate retail pharmacist, to me, is not worth any salary. The stress and the effect the jobs have on ones personal and professional lives is simply not worth it.

HB 42's purpose is to establish reimbursement parity between certified pharmacist clinicians, certain pharmacists and other licensed health professionals for the same clinical services.

HB 42 enacts a new section of the Group Benefits Act titled: Pharmacist Prescriptive Authority Services-Reimbursement Parity. HB 42 establishes the rule that a group health plan will not discriminate with reimbursements under the group health plan against a certified pharmacist clinician or pharmacist certified to provide a prescriptive authority service who is acting within the scope of certification.‚Äù

Patient told me with some sincerity that they don't want to live anymore, don't care about paying for their diabetes scripts anymore, that the funeral will be around the corner, that I'm invited for being nice to them, and that they're going to stop taking the insulin and put themself into a diabetic coma with chocolate.

They reached across the counter and shook my hand when they said the exact words in the title.

We have been using the same pharmacy for this entire ride that started in 2017.  Yesterday I had to go pick up a few of his recurring prescriptions.  I was a pretty worried, because the gastroparesis was kicking his butt.  I must have looked worried.  

Normally a tech takes care of me when I pick up a script.  But they were pretty busy yesterday and the pharmacist helped me.  I have talked to him several times over the last two years. New scripts, drug questions, etc.   He took one look at my face and asked how Andrew was doing.  Were his treatment side effects under control?  How was the gastroparesis?  

He has thousands of patients.  Thousands of spouses of patients.  It was so nice.  I love my pharmacist.

2941,Post,ecmnr1,"Where will the line be drawn?I had to dust off the throwaway for this one. 

On a conference call, the district manager mentioned that the incidence of prescription errors across the company as a whole has increase recently. They made a point to say that within a certain timeframe (or region? Area? I couldn‚Äôt focus on the call 100% because I had to take it in the pharmacy) there had been FOUR DEATHS due to prescriptions being sold to the wrong person. 

The DM used this as a motivator to have everyone review standard operating procedures for picking up a prescription and seemed to suggest it was due to technicians simply skipping steps just because; the error must be due to the staff and not anything corporate has done. 

But what seems painfully, glaringly obvious to me is that in the past 6 months, my company has cut back pharmacist overlap and technician hours while adding on tasks that do not directly contribute to the actual practice of pharmacy. We are expected to attempt 100% of the list of phone calls that generate every day (usually over 30 calls a day) and have ‚Äúmeaningful‚Äù conversations with patients about adherence while still completing the same volume of prescriptions - or more - with LESS staff than I‚Äôve ever seen. If you don‚Äôt reach your targets, you get put on a performance improvement plan. If you don‚Äôt improve, you get fired. Let‚Äôs not even get started on immunization quotas. 

So every task that has to be done is rushed. Every register transaction is rushed. And because the staff is stressed and overwhelmed and constantly interrupted from the time they clock in until the time they clock out, mistakes are made. If there‚Äôs one thing you SHOULD do correctly all day it‚Äôs verifying that the person you‚Äôre selling the bag to is the person who is intended to receive it. But when you put people into these high pressure situations with the bare minimum of support, mistakes are going to happen. They HAVE been happening. 

If four people have died from getting the wrong prescription, how many other instances happened that didn‚Äôt result in lasting harm to the patient? How many times is considered acceptable by almighty corporate? Do they really think it‚Äôs because we collectively just decided to stop following proper procedures or could it possibly be because they‚Äôve actively taken steps to distract us from the core function of our jobs?

Is it really such a big ‚Äúwin‚Äù that adherence calls increase PDC by 5% if the number of people who you kill in your career goes up by 1?",2019-12-19,167

I see a whole lot of jaded pharmacists posting about how you won‚Äôt even be considered for a hospital job until you‚Äôve completed residency and have your BCPS.

I graduated in late 2017. 
I had zero practical hospital experience upon graduating outside of rotations, BUT I made a really good impression on all of the staff and the chief of pharmacy at one of my hospital rotations and despite having zero paid hospital experience, no residency, no BCPS, no experience even as a pharmacist yet, they contacted me after I graduated and asked if I would be interested in an inpatient position.

Now I‚Äôm being contacted by my old chief of pharmacy with offers for Clinical Specialist positions when they open their new hospital in the more populous city I was originally commuting from.

Everyone loves the new grads because you have accrued zero vacation time and 401K to match, and are facing lower salaries for more education, risk and effort, unlike some I know who have 6 weeks vacation  and seniority.

Stay late, don't stay late, be a top performer, be bottom in the country, hours cuts are all coming and they're all going to be the same across the board.

Edit for notable highlights below:

>-Key provision of the bill being drafted would help ensure pharmacists get time to rest: requiring one uninterrupted 30-minute meal break and an additional 15-minute break for any pharmacist who worked six continuous hours, according to the task force recommendation.
The pharmacist would get another 15-minute break for working a full 12 hours ‚Äî a frequent shift for pharmacists at chains and independent drug stores.

>-The proposed changes also would require employers to maintain accurate records of breaks, but the task force rejected proposals to pay a pharmacist triple for each day a break was not provided.

>-Pharmacies could be disciplined for failing to provide adequate time to do several duties, including reviewing a patient‚Äôs drug history, giving immunizations, answering customer questions and verifying the accuracy of prescriptions.¬†

>-The task force underscored the point, saying it ‚Äústrongly believes that activities that distract pharmacists from their jobs are harmful and could affect the safety of the public.‚Äù  The task force cited companies requiring pharmacists to ‚Äúsolicit new business, meet productivity or production quotas, or induce the transfer of prescriptions"" from one pharmacy to another.

>-Pharmacists are protected under whistleblower statutes, a move designed to give pharmacists assurances that they can report company abuses without fear of retaliation.

>-The task force recommended expanding the duties of pharmacy technicians. That includes permitting them to administer vaccinations or immunizations after they‚Äôve undergone nationally certified training. They also would be allowed to transfer prescriptions between pharmacies.¬†",2019-10-25,173

My name is Jaleh Sharify, but I go by the nickname Amy. I am licensed in the state of Wisconsin and my license number is # 17662-40. I use to work for CVS and would never again. I am not afraid of them.

WHERE AM I SENDING THIS TO?

You can print out this form and mail it to me at 1515-B W. Fullerton Ave, Addison, Illinois 60101.

WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THIS?

Once I receive your signed card I will assign it a number, I will log information (no identifying information just non-identifying information) then take it to my bank which is Chase and store it in the safe deposit box that I already rent.  I will report back to you all via this reddit site how many cards I have received in total, how many from each state, and how many from each company.  Hopefully that will spur more people on to send in their card.  If your company /  hospital is small and there are not a lot of pharmacist employees then I will refrain from listing this information as I do not want to take a chance that there could be any repercussions.  After receiving at least 250 cards I will come back to begin discussions regarding what needs to be in the agreement.  The more cards that come in the more I will ramp up activities.  Send in your card and let's get this ball rolling.

EDIT:

Pharmacists have more power than they give themselves credit for, but I know you are all aware of this power.  If you are in a Right to Work State or a Non Right to Work State you still are in a state that requires a pharmacist licensed in that state to have an open pharmacy.  If you are a factory worker in a Right to Work State and your union facility goes on strike for economic reasons can they just hire a number of people off the street to replace you while you strike?  Yes.  If you are a pharmacist in a Right to Work state and you go on strike or threaten a strike or imply a possible strike can they just hire a number of people off the street to replace you while you strike? No.  Do they have enough licensed pharmacists for that state in upper management, as floaters, available in the area as unemployed or underemployed to replace you?  Depends on the number they would have to deal with.  The more people they have to deal with the less capable they would be in overcoming the situation.  Many companies recently have replaced their pharmacist DMs or RMs with non pharmacy personnel.  So, could chain pharmacy operations be slowed or even totally shut down if a percentage of pharmacists in a state threaten to strike? Probably not in one state unless it was a high population state such as Texas, California, New York, Florida, Pennsylvania.  But if it was in two states, then I would say yes, and if it was in three states, most definitely.  More than three states and I think you could throw a massive monkey wrench in the works....get more than one chain's pharmacists to participate and we would be unstoppable.  How long would something like this have to go on before a huge economic pain would be felt by the chains?  I believe not very long.  Imagine a state like California with its chain pharmacy operations cut by 30%.  Imagine now that both California and New York participated.  The chains would be overwhelmed very quickly.  Now add Pennsylvania and few smaller states and they would be totally at the mercy of the workers.  Please start spreading the word.

3131,Comment,exs6q9r,"Hope you guys don‚Äôt mind me nerding out over some zero-order kinetics!

As mentioned in the title, the patient claims to have ingested 100 tabs and presents to the ER a few hours later. It‚Äôs unknown whether or not they were enteric-coated tablets. They didn‚Äôt show much in terms of symptoms other than nausea and tinnitus. Started on D5W + sodium bicarbonate with aggressive potassium repletion to help alkalinize the urine which ultimately helps salicylate elimination. VBG + salicylate levels done Q2H. No acidosis and no resp issues when I last got the update with admission to psych planned right after.

It‚Äôs beautiful how straight that line is on a non-logarithmic scale. Not what you‚Äôd typically see every day, especially for those of us modeling out vancomycin and aminoglycosides all the time.

If you‚Äôll let me indulge ‚Ä¶

As a refresher, most drugs follow first-order elimination pharmacokinetics, i.e. the rate of elimination of a drug is dependent on the concentration. The higher the concentration you have at a given time, the more that is eliminated. Makes sense. What is constant is the **proportion** of drug eliminated per unit time. Mathematically: -dC/dt = kC, which after some integration, you get: **ln(C)=-kt+ln(C0)**.

If you remember from your high school algebra days, the equation for a line is given by y=mx+b. This looks pretty close to ln(C)=-kt+ln(C0) but with logarithms involved. This is why we need to convert our plasma concentrations to a logarithmic scale to get linear graphs. This is what we usually deal with when we talk about drugs and their kinetics. When you talk about half-lives, you‚Äôre assuming first-order kinetics most of the time. Or for some us who do fancy PK modeling calculations for vancomycin, aminoglycosides, tacrolimus, dalteparin, whatever .. we‚Äôre assuming first-order elimination kinetics.

In the case of an ASA overdose, metabolism by the liver into its metabolites becomes saturated resulting in zero-order elimination. The liver has reached its limit as to how much ASA it can metabolize at a time. There‚Äôs only so much ASA you can feed to the liver to actually chew up. In other words, the rate of elimination is **independent** of the concentration and is actually constant. Mathematically, -dC/dt = k. Just as earlier after some integration, we get **C = -kt + C0**.

Again, this looks like y=mx+b‚Ä¶ but we didn‚Äôt need to convert the y-axis this time like we normally would with drugs following first-order kinetics. It‚Äôs linear already.

What‚Äôs beautiful about this patient‚Äôs salicylate levels is how perfectly straight the line is. As every hour passes by, the patient‚Äôs salicylate concentration goes down by exactly 14mg/L. Doesn‚Äôt matter what the concentration is. It‚Äôs not first-order. This will continue until metabolism is no longer saturated and elimination becomes first-order again. A little nerdy but it felt pretty damn good to predict each subsequent level drawn using the fitted equation: \[Salicylate\] = -13.948\*\[hours since 9:55PM\] + 564.5.

As an aside, talking about half-lives for a zero-order process is a bit weird: t1/2 = C0/2k. In other words, it‚Äôs not constant. It actually does depend on the initial drug concentration you‚Äôre looking at.

I know kinetics scared a lot of us in school but hopefully this post made you appreciate it just a little more. Or maybe not.

**EDIT:** I wrote 'ASA levels' in the title. Technically, they were salicylate levels that were measured. ASA is rapidly hydrolyzed into salicylic acid (and other renally eliminated metabolites) and that's what we're tracking.",2019-08-23,179

3157,Post,cpgibe,"I actually saw it! The arrogant customer who said they didn‚Äôt NEED to give their info to pick up their pain meds. Bonus: They‚Äôre going to corporate!!! (Long post ahead, but hopefully one everyone of y‚Äôall will appreciate. Sorry!)Ok, so full disclosure... I‚Äôm not in pharmacy/healthcare. Just a patient who thinks y‚Äôall are neat. Also, this is a long one, but if I left anything out I wouldn‚Äôt be giving you all the full truth, so I‚Äôm sorry for the essay below. 

So about an hour or so ago I was at the Walmart about a block and a half from my house picking up an emergency Rx for my mom. I‚Äôm waiting in line approx 10 ft away from the pick up divider (ya know like halls signs ask us to do) while this guy and his wife were doing their thing. They‚Äôre probably late 20‚Äôs/early 30‚Äôs. By all accounts normal looking people. 

So the wonderfully polite woman working the register/pickup requests the name of the patient. Que homeboy giving his first name only in the most asshole-ish tone possible. So the kind tech (who has that sort of sweetheart grandmother type demeanor) requests his last name. ‚ÄúWhy the fuck would you need that?!‚Äù ‚ÄúI never have to give my last name, you should know who I am!‚Äù The tech responds; ‚ÄúSir, there are other patients here. I need to ask if you‚Äôd please lower your voice and not use profanity.‚Äù 
Homeboy is ENRAGED at the audacity of this woman to speak to him this this manner. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, what did you just say to me?!‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôll do and speak however I goddamn well please!‚Äù Tech who leveled up: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right sir. I‚Äôm very sorry. Unfortunately, my system is pretty old. So I need your full name and DOB. I realize this is unacceptable service, but unfortunately it‚Äôs all I‚Äôve got to work with. I‚Äôm SO sorry!‚Äù Air homeboy literally throwing (what I assume was) his drivers license at her face (seriously directly at this woman‚Äôs face! You believe that shit????!) 

So at this point the tech working with the pharmacist, the drive through tech and the (amazing) pharmacist herself stop everything. The pharmacist removed her white coat, put on the green Walmart vest and went over to the pick up counter. She didn‚Äôt say anything. Just stood there. 

Now that wonderful tech has all the info she needs it turns out homeboy is there to pick up Norco/Soma/Ativan. At this point, the lovely pharmacist smiles, taps the tech on the shoulder and says ‚Äúmind if I take over from here?‚Äù Tech: ‚ÄúSure thing boss!‚Äù

Pharmacist: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry for the bad experience Mr.Jackass. We didn‚Äôt meet your expectations this time and because of that we failed to live up to our standards. I‚Äôll have my tech call a manager to the pharmacy and see if I can‚Äôt get you a gift card for the trouble we caused you. However, I‚Äôm afraid I won‚Äôt be able to fill these prescriptions for you. The FDA and DEA have recently put out new guidelines stating there is no therapeutic reason for this particular combination of meds. It‚Äôs my job and moral and ethical obligation to keep you safe. If you‚Äôd like I‚Äôd be happy to fill ONE of these Rx‚Äôs for you, but there‚Äôs no chance of all three.‚Äù 

At this point the manager has arrived at the pharmacy (with almost perfect timing) to overhear 80% of the pharmacists logic. 

Homeboy: My doctor wrote these prescriptions!!!! You have no goddamn right to refuse them to me. I swear to god if ALL of my Rx‚Äôs aren‚Äôt ready in less than 3 (or however many he actually said) minutes, not only am I going to corporate to report you but I‚Äôm gonna have you investigated and make sure your license is stripped from you!‚Äù 

In what can only be described as a power move on the part of the pharmacist: ‚ÄúWell sir I‚Äôve already made my decision. And in addition to the justifications I‚Äôve already explained, I‚Äôm going to go ahead and add drug seeking behavior to them. So with that said, as you can see my store manager is right here. She‚Äôs overheard most of this so far. But I want to make sure you‚Äôre able to give her your side in its entirety. Also, while you‚Äôre speaking with her, I‚Äôll go ahead and look up my corporate offices phone number along with the number to the BOP who ultimately decided my fate in these matters‚Äù ‚ÄúI understand you‚Äôre upset with me and my pharmacy right now. However, that gives you absolutely no right to abuse my staff, threaten all of us and exhibit the kind of behavior you have this morning. As you might not be aware of the laws regarding controlled substances I want to be as open and honest as possible. At least one of your Rx‚Äôs is what we in the industry call a ‚ÄòC2‚Äô. The rules around these medications are incredibly strict. I have absolutely no ability to disregard the rules and laws surrounding them. So because of this, I am unable to transfer any of these to another pharmacy and frankly even if I were allowed, I‚Äôd make sure to make whatever pharmacy you chose aware of your behavior here today and they‚Äôd almost assuredly take the position I‚Äôve taken this morning. Furthermore, I‚Äôll be calling the prescribed at the first opportunity to make them aware of your actions as well.‚Äù And I swear to god with the most perfect ‚Äúfuck you you worthless sack of shit, kill them with kindness demeanor I‚Äôve EVER seen‚Äù; Pharmacist: Now sir, is there anything else I can assist you with this morning? Otherwise you taken up about 30 minutes of my pharmacies time, made all these other people wait much longer than they deserved to and frankly I‚Äôve more important things to do than continue this conversation.‚Äù 

The manager then requests the ‚Äúcustomer‚Äù follow her to the front to lodge his ‚Äúformal‚Äù complaint and hopefully throw his ass out. At some point during the confrontation the wife had wandered off, presumably out of her embarrassment. So I‚Äôve no idea where she is in opinion about this situation. I assume she went to die by locking herself in their car in the 102 degree heat after having been associated with this tantrum in public. 

Almost unbelievably, after this the entire staff of the pharmacy went right back to business as usual, which, my god the professionalism on those women is just insane! They called me forward after this. I apologized for them having to deal with that, confessed I‚Äôd moved as close as I could after shit hit the fan to get the details and apologized for breaking the ‚Äúwait here for patient privacy sign‚Äù. Wonderful pharm tech was adamant that I DESERVED the apology for being witness to it. You believe that?? She apologized to ME.  After everything she was subjected to. Talk about amazing service, while being forced to deal with a backlog of work now, having a like of 12-15 people at that point while being understaffed!!! LITERALLY INCREDIBLE! They even offered us ‚Äúcustomers‚Äù who watched it all a 15 dollar gift card.  


Even further disclosures: Obviously, I haven‚Äôt recalled literally EVERY word each person used (even though I used quotes), while I was quite a bit further behind the privacy sign than needed, once the shit went down, I kept scooting closer and closer to make sure I got to see ALL the drama. The pharmacist on duty today was the pharmacy manager, which is why I assume she had bigger balls than any man and didn‚Äôt give a flying rats ass about this homeboy ranting (side note: this pharmacist is one of those who knows her patients, always takes a moment to say hello when she sees them... just an all around amazing professional). I‚Äôve exaggerated the story JUST A BIT, but I swear on everything I‚Äôve not made up any details.  

I asked the pharmacist if I could get them all a snack or drink or something to hopefully help them have a better day. She, being a beacon of professionalism kindly refused my offer. But I couldn‚Äôt not do something so I got them a thing of cupcakes from the bakery and a 10 dollar gift card to buy their drink of choice. I hope they accept this because holy shit if anyone deserves it, they do. 

I know that retail can be absolute hell 99% of the time. And it really bothers me to know that the people who take such amazing care of my mother have to deal with it. Which is why I felt obligated with the drinks and cupcakes. Anyway, I thought if there‚Äôs anyone who would appreciated the brass balls on that pharmacy team, it‚Äôd be y‚Äôall. Apologies for taking up so much of your time. 

Hope you all have a good shift with customers/patients who understand the burdens on your shoulders and no funny business to weed out on the controls. And lastly, thanks y‚Äôall. Genuinely. You keep us alive, safe, run interference for us with insurance and doctors and still somehow managed not to lose your humanity.


Edit # whatever at this point. While I‚Äôm grateful for the karma y‚Äôall have given me, please don‚Äôt upvote me further on this. I‚Äôm not trying to be a white knight to the profession in anyway. Like I said at the top, I simply thing that y‚Äôall (and doctors) are just neat. I‚Äôm no where near as smart as even the shittiest tech or worst doctor. Otherwise I‚Äôd pursue a healthcare career. So again, thank you for the upvotes. However, most seem to be split on how much (if any) I‚Äôm lying about. Downvoted (if you feel so inclined) go to town. But I don‚Äôt want to seem any more ‚ÄúWhite Knight‚Äù than I‚Äôve already proclaimed to b",2019-08-12,181

Upon close inspection, the jelly beans in the jar appeared to be roughly the same size and shape as Metformin XR 500mg; the jar they were in was actually the same size as the 500ct stock bottle we carry them in, with maybe a 60 dram-worth added.

So naturally, I guessed 540. Guess how many were in the jar? 542!!!! I had the closest guess today and they just called me to inform me my rent is covered until my lease is up in May of next year :D

A doctor ‚Äúpracticing‚Äù medicine nearly killed my two year old daughter by prescribing an incorrect medication.  That was 20 years ago, and many times since then a pharmacist has intervened and saved her and my life (I always discuss a medication now).

I am deeply indebted to your knowledge and commitment to protecting the health of people you may never meet.  Many people are unaware their doctors do not understand mechanisms of action, (or even the term).  

I cannot adequately express my gratitude.  last night a pharmacist consult confirmed my concerns with two medications for another daughter (complex medical diagnosis) the doctor refused to hear.  Her aorta will remain attached a little while longer than had I blindly trusted a doctor.

APhA wants to talk about how much they do for us, yet have been ineffectually pursuing Provider Status for something like 20 years. 

2/3rd of all pharmacists work in retail, the vast majority for a chain. Maybe APhA would like to actually tap that market. How would one do that? Probably by providing them value. 

I would absolutely love to see mandatory lunch breaks for all pharmacists. I moved from a state that does not have that to a state that does, and it's a life-changer. Being able to step away for 30 minutes and decompress is huge. 

Just as importantly, we need a tech-to-script ratio. Something like for every 8-10 scripts, we get 1 tech hour. Right now CVS is operating at 15scripts per tech hour and it's fucking hell. I honestly wouldn't mind verifying 500 scripts a day by myself *if I have proper technician staffing*.

I know we all think of our expenses and mortgage and kids before we take any action, but everyday it gets worse and worse, they cut more hours and ask for more metrics plus horrible unprofessional treatment from management.

We need to do something before it‚Äôs too late, either union or organization to protect us.  We are not asking for much, we need to be treated fairly we need lunch breaks, enough help, we need to go to bathroom when we get the urge not 5 hours after.

There was a store in my district that was always 3-4 days behind in their queue because they were extremely understaffed. This went on for OVER A YEAR and the PIC recently stepped down. The pharmacists and techs there were amazing but you can't run a 3k rx/week store w/ drive-thru with 2 techs and a pharmacist. Having one more tech on for 8 hours would completely turn around most stores. God forbid the multi-billion $ company spends an extra $80/day (the ROI would be huge, but what do I know.

3339,Post,batxow,"Congratulations to our Idaho brothers and sisters of pharmacyAs some of you may know, a year ago Idaho implemented a pilot program with some local pharmacies that allowed pharmacists to prescribe for certain conditions like UTI, strep, cold, and other minor ailments. 

I am happy to say House Bill 182 was signed into law recently that will redefine the practice of pharmacy on 7.01.19.

Pharmacists are now allowed to prescribe tobacco cessation and PPD skin tests but perhaps the biggest change is allowing the prescribing of drugs, drug categories, or devices that are prescribed within FDA approved labeling AND do not require a new diagnosis, are minor and generally self limiting, have a test that is used to guide diagnosis or clinical decision making and are CLIA waived.

I feel like I‚Äôm letting my patients down, but when a major mistake happens due to the lack of technician help, and it will happen, I can‚Äôt have that be because I failed to protect them. I think that would destroy me. I love my profession. I remember the exact moment that I knew I wanted to be a pharmacist. It changed my life. It gave me purpose. This company has almost destroyed that.

I‚Äôve tried to explain the risks of the current state of my store to my district ‚Äúleader‚Äù, but they don‚Äôt want to hear it. We just get told that this is the new CVS. When I tried to explain that I almost missed a dosing error in a medication for an infant because I was so busy worrying about ringing people up, I got the response of, ‚ÄúWhat does that have to do with me?‚Äù  I was left speechless. Why are people that have zero concerns about patient care in charge of how I help protect my patients?

My resolve was finally broken when I had to start working weekends by myself.  Working a seven hour shift with no breaks for food or the restroom is just too much for me. I left over 50 prescriptions in QP last Sunday because I just couldn‚Äôt do them.  

I leave my store almost every day feeling defeated and ashamed. Ashamed that my mentors, the pharmacists that I idolized early in my career that have retired or passed away, would have no place in this profession now.

It‚Äôs just become so painfully obvious that the higher ups don‚Äôt give one single shit about patient safety or working conditions. This past week we did 1400 scripts with 52 tech hours. Tonight my tech clocked out at 7, leaving me by myself for the final two hours of the shift with a page or so in the queue, our fun new double-sized truck delivery almost untouched, and about 20 transfers to type in and fill by tomorrow (cherry on top: tech was supposed to leave at 6). It only took until about 7:20 until I had 2 waiters to fill, one person wanting Shingrix, someone in lane 1 (with multiple people behind them I could see in the mirror), someone in lane 2, 2 phones ringing, 1 doctor line ringing, and no hope of getting anything accomplished for the rest of the shift. I‚Äôve never in 10 years left more things not finished than I did tonight. And it‚Äôs only going to get worse from here on out. There‚Äôs no reason at this point to think the tech hours will ever come back. I don‚Äôt think anyone at corporate has considered how this is going to affect the company long-term. The short-term gains they‚Äôre making by slashing hours are going to destroy pharmacies in the long-term. The people who actually care about doing what is right for their patients are going to leave, training new hires on the job is going to be next to impossible when you‚Äôre in the red all day every day, employee satisfaction will not even be a thing, and eventually even customers will start to take notice and be able to tell that staffing is the issue not the employees. Like I said, it‚Äôs been about 10 years for me now and I‚Äôve been perfectly content working that entire time until they destroyed our hours about 6 months ago. And now, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a single thing I hate as much as this god forsaken company. I can handle any amount of being busy, but they have crossed the line from crazy busy to downright dangerous. I‚Äôm going to end my rant and stop typing now and go to sleep or else I won‚Äôt stop for the foreseeable future. Congrats on getting out, hopefully I‚Äôll be able to follow in your footsteps.

And to add before I fall asleep, your choice of wording with defeated and ashamed is perfect.

&#x200B;

2 guys came into the store this morning.   Fortunately we had about a 3 second jump as we saw them back in all crazy right in front of the store.

Demanded ""All the stuff"".    After 2 rounds from me  and 7 rounds from them they fled.  No injuries except for the walls.  They didn't even get back into the pharmacy.  It was a 20yard shot, getting (friendly) crap that I missed.

I'm not planning on leaving this store, its my baby.  Fuck living your life in fear.  People need medications, we're a service to the community.  Closing the store just punishes the legit people in my area.

This profession is dangerous.  Be safe everyone.

Edit2: Woke up to random gold.  Thank you kind stranger x 2.  I also want to thank you all for all the support.  Pharmacy is indeed a small community and having the support really helped me a ton last night.

Now that I have time to think clearly after a shitty nights sleep second guessing myself; to all the people who said that I shouldn't have missed, or I put innocent lives in danger, etc.  I respect your opinions, and I really agree with most of them.  However, its easy to armchair SWAT a situation like this after the fact from the safety of your computer. When you have about 3 seconds to prepare, less than 2 seconds to think, and 1 second to react during a situation that really cannot be planned or prepared for, its hard.  Add a bunch of screaming, yelling, adrenaline, and you have a big pot of suck.  Did I do the right thing? Maybe so, maybe not.  I did the best I could.

3414,Post,arf6mr,"The Reality (Ugly Truth) of CVS PharmacyDear Customers of CVS Pharmacy,¬†

&#x200B;

I am a pharmacy Technician. I've been with CVS for 11 years now, and I just gave my 2 weeks‚Äô

notice. Now that I'm not bound by the social media policy, please allow me to divulge to you just

how CVS corporate works...

&#x200B;

First off, all stores are given a ""budget"" of how many hours they are allowed to have scheduled

each week. The allotted hours must NOT go over budget. If it does, the pharmacist in charge

has to write up why more hours were used...then they get in trouble. The pharmacist gets

written up. This is why nothing is ever ready on time, corporate does not allow stores to

schedule the required help to maintain their stores.¬†

&#x200B;

Second, all they care about is ""metrics."" Every week, the store gets a report of scores. How

many people did you sign up for auto-refill? How many people did you sign up for 90-day

supplies? How many people agreed to let you contact their Doctor for more refills? This report

prints out weekly, with a quota. 65% for auto-refill, 55% for 90-day supplies, and 45% for refill

requests. The report has the name of each pharmacy employee, the number of customers they

rang out, and the success percentage. If they are UNDER the quota, they must write up an

action plan on how they will improve their success percentage. If they are constantly below

quota, they get written up. They tell you to ""word it properly"" so people will accept. (Instead of

asking ""would you like us to auto-refill this"" ask ""would you like this ready next time you need it""

so as to make them say yes). If you were signed up for auto- refill without your permission, it's

likely the tech was just trying to save their job.¬†

&#x200B;

Every weekend, the technicians are mandated to make ""PCI calls."" These are calls that get put

into a queue when a medication is ""past due"" to be filled. We are required to call every patient

(usually around 200 calls in my store) to see if they need the med filled. This is also counted as

a metric. We need to get 60% success rate of ""patient care initiative"" refills. We must make at

least 3 rounds of these calls, which means if you don't answer, we have to call at least 3 times

over the weekend to get you to fill the past due script.¬†

Robot calls: we cannot control them. Same with text alerts. It's a corporate thing, not a store

thing.¬†

&#x200B;

We have 5 stations in the pharmacy. Drop Off, production, quality assurance, drive thru, and

pick up. In a perfect world, that means there should be 4 technicians and 1 pharmacist. Nope.

Not at CVS. My store is LUCKY if we get 3 techs in the same shift. It's normally only 2 of us.

That means 2 people to type up scripts, fill scripts, make phone calls, take phone calls, do drive

thru, and handle the register. The techs do most of the work. Pharmacists usually just check the

technicians work. We are trying our best.

&#x200B;

Pharmacists are not allowed to take breaks. Most work 10-12 hour shifts with no break and are

lucky if they get to use the bathroom. They have to eat their food in the pharmacy. Technicians

hardly get breaks either. At my store, every employee is ""encouraged"" (practically forced) to

sign paperwork stating that they don't need a break. Once this is signed, you rarely get

breaks...and it's legal. Techs, however, are NOT ALLOWED to keep food in the pharmacy. The

majority of us go the whole day without eating. Depending on the pharmacist (at least in my

store) they will keep your food with theirs in case Lost Prevention comes in... the pharmacist

claims it's their food.¬†

&#x200B;

Yes, a lot of techs will work off the clock. It's not allowed, but it's the only way work gets done.

Since we are not allowed to go over hours without getting written up, and if customers complain

that scripts aren't filled, we get written up. It's a lose - lose situation. Last week, our lead

technician worked 40 hours on the clock....and 27 hours off the clock. No lunch breaks. Just to

try and get¬† scripts filled. She worked 7am-10pm Monday to Thursday (No breaks), then 9-4

Friday. This is pretty much the norm.¬†

&#x200B;

Be careful when you file a complaint. Corporate does not believe that they are the problem. If

you complain about a pharmacy not having enough help, corporate will send an email to the

store in question, stating the complaint. The pharmacist in charge will then have to contact the

district manager with a written statement stating how the store will improve. If the customer left

their name and phone number, we have to call and make amends.

&#x200B;

The techs must be state and nationally certified, which requires schooling and testing. It is to be

updated every 2 years. They basically make nothing. Average technician pay is $11 an hour.

NOT A LIVABLE WAGE. The pharmacist makes 6 figures...but techs? Not nearly enough for the

amount of work and exhaustion they are put through.

&#x200B;

CVS cares about ONE THING and ONE THING ONLY.¬† Please be patient with the techs and

pharmacists. They are only doing what they're told and threatened to do.¬†

I'm so glad I'm finally leaving. Not only as an employee, but I will never give CVS my business

again.",2019-02-17,200

3434,Post,anxksl,"Hi Pharmacists!! Please be careful when counseling opioid-dependent patients on Narcan!!I know there's been a lot of people pushing for pharmacists/doctors to give Narcan to any patient on ER/LA opioids.  

Just wanted to share what recently happened to one of my patients.

Pt is 86yo, has been on oxycodone ER 20mg q12h for 5 or 6 years.  Rare use of IR - she'll take an oc/apap 5/325 on occasion but averages only 5 of those pills per month.  No benzos, muscle relaxants, or other sedative/hypnotics.  She has severe COPD and is on the full bevy of meds for that.  

When I discussed Narcan with her, she declined the rx b/c (1) she lives alone; (2) she's been on these meds a long time without ever suffering signficant resp depression.  

Then her pharmacist told her ""there's a new law"" and she HAD to accept a Narcan nasal spray.  The pharmacist, who's been filling her COPD meds for over a decade, told her the following (according to the patient, but basically confirmed by the pharmacist): ""You can die from an overdose but this medicine will prevent it.  The main sign of overdose is trouble breathing.  So if you're ever having trouble breathing, you can use this Narcan and it will make you breathe again.""  

Later that day, when my patient was having ""trouble breathing,"" she took the Narcan instead of her albuterol.  Instant withdrawal - she pooped herself, her BP skyrocketed, and she started having heart palpitations and SOB.  She was afraid she was dying and called an ambulance.  After a few hours in the E.R., the naloxone wore off.  But she had thousands of dollars in unnecessary tests and suffered immensely during what she called ""the worst 3 hours of my life.""  

&#x200B;

I'm a big supporter of distributing naloxone.  But it needs to be done thoughtfully.   When people need a dose of naloxone, they're generally not conscious and lucid enough to administer it to themselves.  IMO, the counseling needs to be about using Narcan to save someone else, not ""take this if you're ever feel SOB"".  I've never had a patient overdose on a substance I prescribed.  That doesn't mean that it couldn't happen in the future, but I think the efforts at naloxone distribution would be better focused on young folks who use opioids recreationally/illicitly and less on little old ladies taking stable doses of ER/LA opioids who live alone.

Often times I get calls from doctors and the patient told them I ""refused"" to fill a prescription. Turns out it needs a PA. They sure can have it if they want to pay $1200. And of course I'm not defending the pharmacist if this is actually what they told the patient. But our words get twisted a lot. ""There's a new law"" allowing pharmacists to dispense naloxone. Sometimes the pharmacist may HAVE to offer naloxone if it's pharmacy policy. But yes there should have been more clarification on ""trouble breathing""",2019-02-07,201

3442,Post,alyudx,"Retail-induced panic attack?!!So this just happened today. Throwaway. 

A pharmacist from my local Chocolate-Vanilla-Strawberry dispensary went into a full blown panic attack and was literally forced by the store manager to shut the pharmacy down mid-shift! 

The pharmacy was egregiously understaffed with just 2 techs. Normally there‚Äôd be at least 5-6 techs as they fill about 400-500 daily.  But with the recent hour cuts...it‚Äôs been a shitshow!


 There were lines of customers out the wazoo and a line in drive thru and a mountain pile of scripts not being typed.  A couple of customers went to the store managers to complain about the lack of staff....which led the store managers to walk back there and noticed that the pharmacist was just shut down from their surrounding and not responding appropriately.  The managers closed the gates and sat the pharmacist down who was completely bewildered.  They took the pharmacist‚Äôs BP and it was like....in the 170s/high-90s, whIch is completely abnormal for the pharmacist.  The managers wouldn‚Äôt let the pharmacist drive themself home so they called someone else to take the pharmacist home.  Like what the actual fuck is going on with this shitshow pharmacy company?!!! 

It‚Äôs fucking ridiculous. FUCKING insane.  I‚Äôm fucking livid.  How much longer are we going to put up with this?  Patient lives are at stake. OUR fucking lives are at stake. The fact that customers complained and were concerned for the pharmacist speaks volumes about the direction this company is going??   

I have spoken to so many pharmacists who work in the company who are on medications or are starting medications, myself included.  Is this going to be a requirement now to get a pharmD?? To be on anti-anxiety meds??)

3456,Post,al5fdc,"I'm a pharmacist who learned how to code on my own and automate some pharmacy work. AMAHi everyone, recently I commented on the career thread about my experience learning to code as a pharmacist and automating pharmacy work. Someone wanted me to expand on it, so here we go!

**Background**

I worked as a community pharmacist in Canada for a couple of years. When I graduated I felt like I had more free time than when I was in school, so I explored learning different things, one of which was coding. Initially I worked with a friend to make some websites and blogs and got my first exposure to web design and basic coding. Even learning the basics opens up your eyes to so many possibilities. I saw that there were quite a few tasks in the pharmacy that were very repetitive and could be automated.

For my first program, I decided to make software that could help track lab values better for patients taking clozapine. If you're not familiar with this, patients taking clozapine have to go for lab tests regularly (WBC and ANC) due to the risk of fatal agranulocytosis. In the first six months, they have to go weekly. In the next six months, they can go every two weeks. And after a year of no complications, they need to go every 4 weeks. Our system was a combination of excel spreadsheets, paper, and the existing software provided by each company that manufactured clozapine. The software I made allowed the pharmacist to keep track of all their patients in one location. If you're interested in learning how to make something like this, see the 'Web app' and 'data visualization' tracks below.

Another program I made would figure out which 'daily dispense' prescriptions were going to expire soon. Daily dispense prescriptions allow you to dispense a medication each day and be reimbursed for the dispensing fee daily (useful for patients with poor compliance). However they expire in 60 days rather than 1 year. The pharmacy I worked out had a large number of these patients, and so we had to manually scroll through a spreadsheet to check for due dates. This task would take 1-1.5 hours. I made a desktop app that automatically parsed through the spreadsheet to figure out prescriptions were expiring soon, and order them into a nice list (see the 'data science' track below).

Another program I made was ineedmymeds This was a fun project at a data hackathon where the theme was to make something using open source data. The premise of the project was that whenever there's a manufacturer shortage for a medication and the patient's pharmacy doesn't have it, the patient and pharmacist have to call around other pharmacies to figure out who has it. We thought it would be interesting if there was a web app for patients to say which meds they want (without revealing their info) and pharmacies could take a look at which meds were requested and see which ones they have in stock. Then this info would be available on the site. Unfortunately it's been difficult getting people to use the site. If you're interested in making something like this, see the 'web app' and 'web design' tracks below.

It was at that hackathon where I met my current employer. He thought the idea was interesting so we worked on it together. Afterwards, I mentioned that I wanted to transition into a software developer job and he hired me since he saw how I worked and some of my previous projects.

**Learning to code on your own recommendations**

I think that instead of a general approach to learning how to code, you should think about what sort of project you want to do. It's a more holistic way of learning. Are you interested in munging through data (excel spreadsheets) and automating that work or finding interesting patterns? Are you interested in making web apps? Are you interested in data visualization and cool charts and graphics?

It's a lot easier and more fun to learn to code when you're working on something you really want to make. Here is a list of tracks and what resources I recommend.

***Data science***

* Python is probably the go-to language you want to learn

1.Absolute beginner:

* Code academy ([https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3))  ($)
   * When I took the program it was free, but now it's paid. Regardless, I started out with this program and do recommend it if you don't have any experience at all.

2.Basic python

* Think Python book ([https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python/](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python/)) (free)
   * After doing the codeacademy course, I moved onto this free book. It definitely improved my programming abilities significantly.

3.Basic Data science:

* Data camp ([https://www.datacamp.com/courses/tech:python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/tech:python)) ($)
   * I've taken a few of the data camp courses and can recommend some of them. It'll teach you some basic skills to manipulate data and create visualizations.

4.Machine learning:

* Fast ai ([https://www.fast.ai/](https://www.fast.ai/)) (free)
   * This is only for more advanced programmers but the fast ai course is absolutely phenomenal. It's specifically targeted for programmers and you don't need an advanced math degree since the instructor explains concepts very well.

***Data visualization***

* I would recommend learning javascript because the best data visualization libraries for the web, IMO, are written in javascript

1.Absolute beginner:

* Code academy ([https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript)) (free)
   * Again, code academy is a great place to start for absolute beginners.

2.Basic javascript:

* Watchandcode ([https://watchandcode.com/](https://watchandcode.com/)) (free course and $premium tier)
   * The instructor at watchandcode is one of the best programming teachers I've ever had. I highly recommend his free course, and if you're interested in improving your javascript skills to the intermediate level, take his premium course.

3.Data visualization with D3.js ([https://www.udacity.com/course/data-visualization-and-d3js--ud507#](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-visualization-and-d3js--ud507#)) (free)

* D3.js is a tool that is considered the go-to for data visualization on the web. I actually haven't taken this specific udacity course, but I've taken another udacity one before and they tend to be okay.

***Web app***

* I would recommend python since the web app framework Flask is very simple to learn and get started with.

1.Absolute beginner:

* Code academy ([https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3))  ($)

2.Basic python

* Think Python book ([https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python/](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python/)) (free)

3.Flask book ([https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/flask-web-development/9781491991725/](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/flask-web-development/9781491991725/)) ($)

* Flask is web framework that's very popular amongst python programmers. It's also simple to get started with. This book is the go-to resource for learning flask.

***Web design***

* Enjoy making fancy websites and cool designs? HTML and CSS is what you want to learn
* Shay Howe has a fantastic free resource to learn the fundamentals ([https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/))
* Afterwards, you can try to pick up more advanced CSS layout methods like flexbox ([https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/))

***Comp Sci***

* If you're interested in learning more comp sci stuff, I would actually recommend getting some practical coding skills first. Python is a good first language to learn

1.Absolute beginner:

* Code academy ([https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3))  ($)

2.Comp sci course:

* Harvard's CS50 ([https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x))
   * I haven't taken this specific course, but it's highly recommended. You can also pay for a certification once you finish it.

3.Structure and interpretation of computer programs (SICP) (free)

* This is basically the bible of introductory CS ([https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html)). It's difficult to get through (I'm still working on it!) but your programming skills will increase significantly.
* If you prefer a video version, Berkely offers a modern alternative: [https://cs61a.org/](https://cs61a.org/)

***Linux***

* Learning how to use linux is very helpful if you're interested in programming in an environment that makes it easier to get all the tools and dependencies you need. Or if you like working on servers and stuff.

1. Try using Ubuntu. You can even just try it out on a usb stick ([https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/installation-guide/index.html](https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/installation-guide/index.html)).

**Boot camps, comp sci degrees and full online programs?**

Some people like an environment with instructors and other peers. If that's you, here are some thoughts about boot camps, comp sci degrees and online programs. I would still recommend taking a shot at one of the tracks above to see if you actually enjoy coding before you invest significant time and money into a formal program. The programs in the self-learning track above may cost a bit, but much less than what you'd have to pay for formal programs.

I did not go this route so do take this with a grain of salt.

Many boot camps seem to be taking advantage of the hot market so you really need to do your research. Go to their demo days and talk to the grads. Then talk to people who have finished the program and are a few months out. See what they actually end up doing. I've seen crazy stats where more than half of the boot camp grads do not actually end up in a software developer job.

One boot camp that I've heard good things about is Lambda School ([https://lambdaschool.com/](https://lambdaschool.com/)) because their incentive is to get you as high paying a job as possible since they only get paid if you get a good paying job.

As for comp sci degrees, find out if your local uni/college offers a condensed version. The condensed versions seem to be offered towards people already with a bachelor's so they tend to be only 2-3 years in length rather than 4. Generally I've heard good things about these, but of course they depend on the school itself.

Online programs vary quite a bit. A popular one is the nanodegree offered by Udacity. Again, you really need to talk to the grads in the programs that you're interested in and figure out the reality of those programs and not what is advertised.

**But what about certifications?!**

Yes, yes, I'm getting to it. With the self-learning track you won't get any certifications. BUT, you'll have a great portfolio because you'll be learning to build practical projects and you might even have a project of your own. It's a lot easier to learn comp sci fundamentals when you have practical skills, than if you learn comp sci theory without any coding background.

If you want certifications, look at what topics you're interested in and pick out some courses from Coursera or Edx where they offer a certification of completion. For example, this one is a very popular intro to compsci course ([https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x)) that offers a certification if you pay $90, or free if you don't want the certification.

Learning to code has become much easier over these last few years. If you still feel a bit overwhelemed, I'm thinking of setting up an online course where I can teach what I've learned, and some of the projects I've made that are actually used in the pharmacy. I don't want to be spammy, so if you're interested in this, send me a DM (or let me know if you want me to reply with a link here or in the comments below).

Feel free to ask questions!

3486,Post,a8rkyl,"An open letter I wrote to PharmacistsDear Pharmacists,       

&nbsp;

I need you to know that you are undervalued, disrespected, and often flat out abused. Your concerns for your profession are absolutely valid. I see the evidence everyday, whether I‚Äôm in line to pick up or sitting behind a desk. For the last five years i‚Äôve worked as an MA for a GP, and a few specific industry injustices have become clear to me:

&nbsp;

- PRESCRIBERS ARE EXPECTED TO WORK BUSINESS HOURS, PHARMACISTS ARE EXPECTED TO WORK ALL HOURS. This imbalance unjustly punishes pharmacists, again and again and again. By now most Doctors and staff have a basic understanding of the prior-auth rules, and prescribe accordingly, but restrictions are getting more unpredictable everyday (PA requirements for GENERICS). Unfortunately, most patients choose to pick up prescriptions at their convenience, in the evenings or on weekends. Should any issues arise in terms of coverage, dosage, or directions, the pharmacist is required to call and straighten things out with the doctor before dispensing. Since doctors offices are usually closed during the evening and on weekends, the pharmacist is left to explain to the patient why they‚Äôll need to wait a few days for their Rx. This conversation is rarely pleasant, and can lead to continuous altercations between entitled patients and pharmacists. Now the pharmacist is seen as the ‚Äúbad guy‚Äù purely because he is the only person available. In addition, some doctors offer false information regarding copays or coverage to patients. These patients often argue when pharmacists tell them that the doctor was incorrect, ""But my doctor said! Just do it!"". Instead of blaming the doctor for poor information, they direct their anger at the pharmacist. It makes no sense.

&nbsp;

- IT IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO SPEAK TO A DOCTOR. As a receptionist, it is our job to screen calls to save time for the doctor. My first week on the job I learned that if another doctor calls, he is immediately put through to the doctor. The week following, a pharmacist called to verify directions on a prescription, and so I put him through to the doctor immediately the way I would with a doctor. After the phone call, the doctor took me aside. He said that if a pharmacist were to call again, I was to take a message and call back later to inform them of  his response. This made it clear how little respect he had for pharmacists, and that attitude trickled down to his employees. For example, my coworker would frequently toss or shred faxes from pharmacies that she didn‚Äôt feel like dealing with. Other doctors offices claim to be ‚Äúvery busy‚Äù and may not respond for days if at all. All the pharmacy can do is wait and bear the brunt of the dissatisfied patients. 

&nbsp;

- INSURANCE COMPANIES RUN THE GAME WHILE REMAINING UNREACHABLE. Complex formularies cut costs for insurance providers, but they create a headache for everyone else. Insurance companies often require prior authorizations to determine whether a drug is covered or not. PA responses can take anywhere from 1 to 3 days, leaving frustrated patients without treatment. Approvals are still only valid for a year or so, meaning the entire process must be repeated annually for each drug and each patient for no reason (other than hoping you won't bother). Do the insurance companies call the patients and let them know all of this? Never. That nightmare is left to pharmacists and doctors offices, who are tasked with calling patients to deliver the bad news and absorb any frustration. Even phone calls to insurance companies are useless across the board. After a half hour of prompts and hold-music, a customer service representative comes on the line. These reps are powerless within the company, and complaining to them is a waste of time. Mostly they reiterate coverage information and ‚Äúapologize for the inconvenience‚Äù. Policy writers and medical directors don't pick up phones.

&nbsp;

- THE PUBLIC HAS NO IDEA WHAT PHARMACISTS ACTUALLY DO. No they aren‚Äôt errantly throwing pills in a bottle. I don‚Äôt know the process but I know that they are responsible for so much more. Pharmacists are responsible for drug interactions screening, providing counsel to anyone who wanders inside, taking verbal orders by phone, overseeing technicians, diffusing emotional customers, verifying insurance coverage, and so much more. The amount of prescriptions coming in has skyrocketed in recent years as well, meaning MORE calls, MORE fills, and MORE pills, and the same amount of time to get it done. Pharmacy staff work their fingers to the bone just to hear, ‚ÄúWhat took so long? You‚Äôre only putting a few pills in a bottle!‚Äù Customers are also permitted to check out non-pharmacy items at the pharmacy counter, which I believe should be outlawed. Not only does it waste time, it sets a bad precedent by leading customers to equate pharmacy staff with register attendants, further diminishing the customer‚Äôs respect for them.

&nbsp;

On behalf of everyone out there I‚Äôd like to say that I APPRECIATE YOU. 
I appreciate that you applied a coupon to my expensive Rx without me even knowing one existed, I appreciate your repeated calls to my doctor‚Äôs office to check the status of my PA, and I appreciate you offering sound counsel whenever I need it. In return, I promise to do my best to educate others on this subject in whatever way I can. I encourage you to band together and demand change for your entire industry. I am happy to stand beside you in the fight should I be useful. 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

I see you, I see all that you do, and I respect you. Thank you.",2018-12-23,205
3487,Comment,ece7i7b,"We do appreciate this.  Pharmacists have no voice in politics and I do not expect that to change any time soon.  If you look what nursing has done for themselves in the last 10 years, it becomes clear.  It seems to be more about lobbying than anything else.  This is not to say they aren't deserving, but our profession has essentially stagnated while adding 3 or more years of education just to become licensed. ",2018-12-23,205
3488,Post,a7pz22,"r/pharmacy 2019 demographics survey results!The r/pharmacy 2019 demographics survey is now closed! There was a massive amount of data (645 respondents), so if there's any question you want answered (eg, what's the average salary for a PGY-1 resident?), please feel free to ask in the comments! Please note that the numbers will not always add up to 100%, since all questions in the survey were optional.

**Location**

Surprising no one, the vast majority of respondents (583; 90.4%) were from the US. Next were Canada (33; 5.1%), UK (8; 1.2%), Australia (3; 0.5%), Brazil (2; 0.3%), and New Zealand (2; 0.3%); and then one person each from Denmark, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Lithuania, Malaysia, Norway, Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland, and Syria.

Of the 583 Americans, the top three states were Texas (50; 8.6%), California (43; 7.4%), and Florida (36; 6.2%).

Of the 33 Canadians, the top three provinces were Ontario (12; 36.4%), British Columbia (6; 18.2%), and Quebec (4; 12.1%).

**Demographics**

Of the 645 respondents, 335 (51.9%) were male, and 308 (47.8%) were female.

Age distribution is shown in the below table. Some stats: minimum 15, maximum 66, mean 28.3, median 27, mode 26.

https://preview.redd.it/jhggfw6qtf521.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=c7fa0fdd5e4cf133c0d9fdc187c56e74b791a847

In terms of race/ethnicity, the top two categories were white (449; 69.6%) and Asian (116; 18.0%), followed by Hispanic or Latino (18; 2.8%), two or more races (18; 2.8%), Indian subcontinent (16; 2.5%), black (11; 1.7%), Arab (9; 1.4%), Native American or American Indian (2; 0.3%), Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander (1; 0.2%), and Middle Eastern (1; 0.2%).

**General employment questions**

Of the 645 respondents, 397 (61.6%) were pharmacists, 116 (18.0%) were pharmacy students, 91 (14.1%) were non-pharmacist staff (eg, pharmacy technicians, assistants, and cashiers), 19 (2.9%) were pre-pharmacy students, 9 (1.4%) were other healthcare professionals, 8 (1.2%) were non-healthcare professionals, and 3 (0.5%) chose ""other"".

Most respondents (439; 68.1%) were employed full time (defined as > 30 hours), while 59 (9.1%) were employed part time. 118 respondents (18.3%) were full time students (not necessarily pharmacy), 10 (1.6%) were unemployed, and 7 (1.1%) were working outside of the field of pharmacy.

There was a fairly close split between respondents working in suburban (267; 41.4%) and urban (236; 36.6%) locations, followed far behind by those working in rural locations (85; 13.2%) or working from home/remotely (12; 1.9%).

A pie chart of primary place of employment is shown below, with the top five responses shown in the legend: community/retail (315; 48.8%), hospital including outpatient (171; 26.5%), unemployed (22; 3.4%), long-term care/hospice (16; 2.5%), and mail order/specialty/infusion (16; 2.5%). Please note that the unemployed category includes non-working full time students.

https://preview.redd.it/tfzfap9csf521.png?width=382&format=png&auto=webp&s=449ddb1a58f30e80374acd63173d79899b041bbd

A small proportion (120; 18.6%) of respondents reported having a second job. Of these, the most common fields of employment were: community/retail (31; 25.8%), non-pharmacy related job but not including self-employment (24; 20%), and hospital including outpatient (24; 20%).

**Salary**

For the following analyses, I only included those working full time, since including everyone would skew the data. Below is the histogram for pharmacist salary (worldwide). I did do a bit of data cleaning on this for what I felt were obvious data errors (eg, salary of $1,250,000 for a hospital pharmacist; if that was you and it was actually correct, bravo!).

https://preview.redd.it/v80ileydsf521.png?width=356&format=png&auto=webp&s=cab48d90dbd421e4ecb557a60dc6b221497e3c8f

As has been noted before on this subreddit, salaries for full time pharmacists were much higher in the US compared to ex-US. Here are the stats for the US: minimum $41,000; maximum $250,000; mean $120,600; median $122,000. And stats for ex-US: minimum $15 (I think/hope this was a data entry error, but I didn't know what was intended so I left it alone); maximum $105,000; mean $60,421; median $67,000.

And here's the histogram for full time non-pharmacist staff (worldwide):

https://preview.redd.it/7ksvcb5fsf521.png?width=271&format=png&auto=webp&s=2415fb2ab690b1ca60fb0ed1060854b6edb30d3d

There was only one ex-US respondent in this category, so I included that person together with the Americans. Stats for full time non-pharmacist staff salaries: minimum $12,000; maximum $60,000; mean $35,264; median $35,000.

**Community/retail pharmacy**

Just under half (315; 48.8%) of respondents reported working in community/retail pharmacy. Of these, over half (172; 54.6%) worked in a chain, followed by supermarket (50; 15.9%), independent (45; 14.3%), big box (32; 10.2%), and wholesale club (11; 3.5%), as shown in the pie chart below (only top 5 responses shown in legend).

https://preview.redd.it/6rik66agsf521.png?width=289&format=png&auto=webp&s=b466937dd60677d67712b341eea879ae47969f93

Roles within community/retail pharmacy are displayed below, again with only the top 5 responses shown in the legend.

**Hospital pharmacy (including hospital outpatient)**

There were 171 respondents (26.5%) who reported working in hospital pharmacy (including hospital outpatient). Bed count at their hospitals is shown in the graph below.

https://preview.redd.it/psxm9yvisf521.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa15216723b53f857f0e3b4e87bde67eaa0c592e

Roles within hospital pharmacy are displayed below, with the top 5 responses shown in the legend.

https://preview.redd.it/03ax28rjsf521.png?width=249&format=png&auto=webp&s=0232032088e099825e6a1b4998c5da14e904f2b1

Of 140 hospital pharmacists, 55 (39.3%) had completed a residency, and 15 (10.7%) were currently completing their residencies. The other half (70; 50%) were not pursuing nor had ever completed a residency.

The top three clinical specialties were oncology (19 respondents), emergency medicine (11 respondents), and pediatrics (8 respondents). Note that it was possible to choose more than one specialty.

**Pharmaceutical industry**

Only 12 respondents (1.9%) reported working in the pharmaceutical industry. The breakdown by department was as follows: Marketing/Business Analytics (4; 33.3%), Medical/Scientific Affairs (3; 25%), Drug Safety and Risk Management/Pharmacovigilance (2; 16.7%), Medical Communications/Education/Information (2; 16.7%), and Medical Science Liaison (1; 8.3%). The breakdown by level was as follows: Associate/Specialist (5; 41.7%), Manager/Supervisor (5; 41.7%), and Director (2; 16.7%).

**Pharmacy and pre-pharmacy students**

There were 137 respondents who reported being pharmacy or pre-pharmacy students. Of these, the top three desired fields following graduation were hospital including residencies (43; 31.4%), community/retail (33; 24.1%), and undecided (16; 11.7%).

These 137 students were attending (or planned to attend) 72 different schools worldwide. The three most common schools reported were Duquesne University (5; 3.6%), University of Missouri at Kansas City (4; 2.9%), and Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences (4; 2.9%).

The 137 students were broken down pretty evenly by year: 28 (20.4%) were undergraduates/pre-pharmacy, 23 (16.8%) were PY1, 24 (17.5%) were PY2, 29 (21.2%) were PY3, and 32 (23.4%) were PY4. Seventeen PY4 students reported having a job lined up for after graduation, most (15; 88.2%) in a community/retail setting (disclaimer: I'm not sure this question was answered correctly, because I also got 32 ""no"" responses despite having only 32 PY4 students total).

Of the 137 students, 107 (78.1%) were currently working in a pharmacy setting, while 29 (21.2%) were not. Statistics for the approximate number of hours worked per week were: minimum 2; maximum 45; mean 16.5; and median 15.

**Pharmacists**

As stated above, 397 (61.6%) of all respondents were pharmacists, from 118 different pharmacy schools. The three most common alma maters were: University of Illinois at Chicago (10; 2.5%), Duquesne University (8; 2.0%), and University of Pittsburgh (8; 2.0%).

The vast majority of pharmacists (363; 91.4%) were currently practicing pharmacy. Thirteen (3.3%) had practiced in the past but were no longer practicing, while 18 (4.5%) had never practiced after graduating. Of those currently practicing pharmacy, the statistics on the number of years in practice were as follows: minimum 0.1; maximum 39; mean 4.4; and median 3.

The highest pharmacy degree held by respondents were as follows: doctorate (356; 89.7%), master's (8; 2.0%), bachelor's (29; 7.3%), and Staatsexamen (1; 0.3%).

The most common postgraduate training completed or being pursued by respondents were: PGY-1 residencies (94; 23.7%), Board of Pharmacy Specialties (59; 14.9%), PGY-2 residencies (24; 6.0%), Master of Science (8; 2.0%), and Master of Business Administration (6; 1.5%). Note that respondents could choose more than one postgraduate training option.

The most common Board of Pharmacy Specialties were: Pharmacotherapy (60), Critical Care Pharmacy (9), Geriatric Pharmacy (7), Oncology Pharmacy (6), and Ambulatory Care Pharmacy (6). Note that respondents could choose more than one BPS certification.

**Pharmacy residents**

One hundred respondents stated that they had either completed or were currently pursuing a pharmacy residency. Of those, there were 14 current PGY-1 residents, three current PGY-2 residents, and 81 respondents who had completed their residencies.

Of the 14 current PGY-1 residents, six (42.9%) planned to pursue a PGY-2 residency, three (21.4%) planned to work as inpatient staff pharmacists, and three (21.4%) planned to work as inpatient clinical specialty pharmacists.

The three PGY-2 residents were specialized in critical care, emergency medicine, and oncology.

Of the 81 respondents who had completed their residencies, 18 (22.2%) had done both a PGY-1 and a PGY-2 residency. The most common PGY-2 residency specialties were: informatics (3; 16.7%), critical care (3; 16.7%), and emergency medicine (3; 16.7%). Immediately after completing their residencies, the most common career paths were: inpatient staff pharmacist (28; 34.6%), inpatient clinical specialty pharmacist (25; 30.9%), outpatient pharmacist (8; 7.4%), and ambulatory care pharmacist (8; 7.4%).

**Thoughts about the field of pharmacy**

Our three favorite things about the field of pharmacy were: helping patients (242; 37.5%), interest in science/opportunities for learning (202; 31.3%), and the pay (82; 12.7%).

Our three least favorite things about the field of pharmacy were: corporate-mandated metrics (192; 29.8%), bad patient interactions (141; 21.9%), and health insurance/PBM issues (111; 17.2%).

The top three improvements that we felt would have the most impact were: decreasing the number of pharmacy schools and/or imposing class size limits (157; 24.3%), improved staffing (132; 20.5%), and improved working conditions (67; 10.4%).

**Closing thoughts**

Thank you again to all of you who participated! If there's any statistic you'd like to know about that wasn't posted here (eg, what's the average salary of a PGY1 resident?), please feel free to ask!

I would ideally like to run this survey again in the future, so I'm happy to accept any feedback you may have. In particular, some people noted that the survey was very geared toward community and also very US-centric, which are very legitimate comments. Unfortunately, those are the areas I'm more familiar with - so PLEASE feel free to reach out with any questions you'd like to see in the future.

Another comment I received was that the term ""ancillary staff"" was perceived as demeaning. I want to apologize for any hurt I may have caused by using that term; it's simply the term that my state's pharmacy laws and regulations use to refer to non-pharmacist staff, and I didn't give any thought to how it could be perceived - so please accept my apologies.

In terms of repetition in the questions - unfortunately, part of that is the form design, because I needed to re-ask questions in order to direct people to different sections of the survey. Sorry about that!

Hope you all enjoyed the results, and again please let me know if you have any questions or comments! Cheers!",2018-12-19,206

Those 9-5 jobs and ‚Äúeasy‚Äù gigs aren‚Äôt all that either. I have so many friends who would kill for my schedule and can‚Äôt stand their office job. In fact, it‚Äôs pretty universal. You can say ‚Äúthey haven‚Äôt worked retail they‚Äôd appreciate it‚Äù but really I think it‚Äôs just human nature to preferably not have to work anywhere. A job is a job. It‚Äôs a means to an end and there is no perfect job. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve heard anyone ‚Äúlove‚Äù their 9-5 gig. Sure it‚Äôs got its perks but working less days as a pharmacist is pretty nice too! 

We make a difference in people‚Äôs lives. Yeah maybe it‚Äôs something small but that feeling when a patient shows appreciation (I‚Äôm in retail) is so heartwarming and reminds me why we do this. People appreciate us more than we realize. It‚Äôs easy to focus on the 5% of people who are negative and angry but most aren‚Äôt. 

Yeah school sucks and we spend a lot on loans for a declining job market but we still make a comfortable living and way more than the poor technicians who deal with the brunt of the work. We aren‚Äôt driving maseratis but we aren‚Äôt starving or impoverished like many people in the world are.

Thank you all. Thanks for always being there when I need you. I personally think one of the most noble things a person can do is to help others.

Thank you for working tirelessly. Thank you for always being there. Thank you for watching out for me even when I can‚Äôt be bothered. Thank you for putting up with all of those drug seeking addicted assholes who don‚Äôt give a shit how many people they hurt and keeping them separated from the rest of us. Thank you for putting up with my shitty insurance company who (seemingly) does anything they can to be a pain in your ass and not letting it effect the level of care and professionalism I get from you. But most importantly of all, thank you for being you. Healthcare in the US is a crap shoot at best. It‚Äôs beyond comforting to know that no matter how sick I or my family may get, I can always come to you all and get the best possible information and care.

You‚Äôve gotten a lot of great answers here, but you specifically asked for information about working conditions for pharmacists, and I think the public would be appalled to know the truth behind that question. In my personal opinion, the expectations placed on pharmacists in the retail sector are truly a public health concern, not just a concern for pharmacists. 

I know that most people don‚Äôt realize that there is a possibility that the person responsible for final verification of their medications may have been standing in the same spot for 14 hours, checking hundreds of prescriptions through absolutely CONSTANT interruptions and high pressure to go faster, without so much as an opportunity to grab a bite to eat or even use the restroom. Some pharmacists here may say that those are simply people that don‚Äôt respect themselves or are incompetent, but with the market conditions heading the direction they are, more and more (especially new) pharmacists will feel trapped this way, as there may be literally hundreds of people lined up behind them to take their spot, desperate to pay off looming student loan debt. Other pharmacists may feel the rate they work at is safe, because they‚Äôve grown used to it, and may never know just what errors have slipped by.

I could go on about this at length, but I‚Äôll try to restrain myself. Feel free to message me if you want to talk more. I‚Äôve honestly considered going into public health as a new career direction because the way healthcare is structured right now is so terrifying to me. ",2018-09-17,215

3587,Post,9bj2zh,"Opioid argument with Physician left me fuming (Long)Hey guys, I really need help with this one. Scenario happened yesterday and I can‚Äôt tell you how pissed off I was/still am. Even one of my techs took notice and asked if I needed to take a minute, which I did, and I almost never do. Anyway here‚Äôs the scenario, would appreciate any feedback/support/advice. 


Had an Rx come in for Percocet 5/325 #5. Filled it. On verification it said patient had an opioid allergy with no details of the reaction. Fine, it‚Äôs probably nothing, just the usually nausea/vomiting, but if it is something better be safe than sorry, so I put it a mandatory forced counsel at the register to confirm what kind of allergy to opioids the patient has, so we can‚Äôt sell the script until a pharmacist speaks to her. 

She comes in we talk, turns out it‚Äôs legit. She has an allergy to codeine, and states that her throat starts to swell up and it gets hard for her to breath. Now this is a true allergy. I explain to the patient the risk of cross sensitivity (which is probable given they‚Äôre both phenanthrenes, albeit from natural and semi synthetic classes, the risk is definitely still there), we have a legitimately good discussion and she states that she definitely doesn‚Äôt want to take it if there‚Äôs even a small risk of that happening again, that she‚Äôs not really in that much pain and she‚Äôs only here because the doctor told her she should get it because she needs to have something.  She states she‚Äôs going to call her doctor and discuss alternatives or what to do. 


Few minutes later I get an escript for hydrocodone Apap 5/325 #5. Oh great here we go again. Same predicament. I figure maybe the doctor just needs a little help, so I again alert the patient and tell her I‚Äôll  call the office to make a recommendation. Figured it‚Äôd be an easy conversation, this is what me and the patient talked about, she seems really worried about the cross sensitivity of the allergy, and she states she‚Äôs not in a lot of pain. How about tramadol? Oh boy was I wrong. 


This physician got on the phone with an immediate attitude problem. Starts immediately attacking me for lying to his patient. Tells me there‚Äôs absolutely no cross sensitivity between those drugs whatsoever. That if I had a doctorate I should start putting it to use because medicine can‚Äôt be practiced following only a book word for word, there‚Äôs a lot of gray,  That he‚Äôs been doing this for 20 years and that I‚Äôm lying to his patient. Just give the patient the medication, there‚Äôs no problem with it. How he doesn‚Äôt understand who I am to question him.  This guy, everything he said, pissed me the fuck off. He made it clear from the get go that he had no interest in hearing what I had to say, and the only reason he picked up the phone was to force me to fill and sell the script to his patient while being an asshole about it. 

I tried explaining to him that there most definitely is a risk, and I‚Äôm not going to lie to the patient and say there isn‚Äôt one just because he has a knowledge gap and that the patient has a right to be informed. I also told him his behavior and condescending attitude is highly unprofessional and that he needs to work on his inter professional skills. 

Then he starts going off on some tangent about how medicine in the real world is different from the books you read. If a patient has an allergy to Amoxicillin you can still give them Augmentin and they‚Äôll be fine. This is where I drew the line. Just the absurdity of that statement alone made me realize this guy is a terrible doctor.  I told him that is simply not true and that if he does this he really needs to rethink how he practices medicine. As someone who is allergic to amoxicillin, I would immediately ask for another doctor if my current one tried to prescribe Augmentin. (Sidebar: maybe there is some case where this would be necessary, but honestly you‚Äôd have to legitimately have no better option)

Now I can put up with a lot, especially if it means swallowing my pride some, so that my patient walks away happy and confident on their path to better health, but after that comment about Augmentin it became abundantly clear that this conversation was going nowhere and that he had no interest aside from trying to force my hand. So I said to him: 

‚ÄúSir, here‚Äôs the thing. I spoke to the patient, I explained to her the concerns about the medication. I called you to see how we could work together to come up with a more appropriate therapy for her, but all I‚Äôve come away with from this conversation is that you have very little knowledge of allergies, very little interest in providing good therapy for your patients, and even less respect for other medical practitioners. As such I will not be filling this prescription for the patient as I do not believe it‚Äôs safe for her to receive it and because I have serious doubts about the knowledge of the practitioner who wrote it. I‚Äôll be sure to let the patient know that the reason she can‚Äôt get her medication is due to your unwillingness to communicate and take the issue seriously.‚Äù 


He kept trying to speak over me towards the end and ask for the pharmacy manager, and my supervisor. I‚Äôm the pharmacy manager. I told him I hope he decides to research the issue and reflect on his prescribing practices before he writes his next script and hung up. 


I really don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm asking for from you guys. Support I guess? Did I miss anything here? Did I do something wrong. I guess I‚Äôm still just really mad about how condescending this guy was. I‚Äôve dealt with bad doctors before, but this guy was just on another level entirely.  Anyway, thanks for reading everyone!",2018-08-30,217

A doc a few months back placed a Lexapro patient on 300mg amiodarone BID, knowing full well she's on it. I called saying there's an interaction, he responded to cancel the order, and will send it to another pharmacy that'll dispense without question. He called the patient's daughter, got her riled up, and she called us asking why her mom's meds aren't being done, got off the phone saying we're incompetent. 

4 days later, the daughter and doctor called us, patient passed, asked why we weren't adamant about not filling the script. We refused to fill the script, called all parties, informed all parties, got a face full of shit in return, and when shit goes down, it's our fault.

3610,Post,8xk6fo,"[X-Post] Someone suggested I share this here... My dad wanted me to be a construction worker, refused to help me with university. I just got accepted to a Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) program all on my own. (Long)My dad wanted me to be a construction worker and after high school that is what I did. I hated it and got myself fired after 6 months. He was severely angry with me and said I was good for nothing and going nowhere. I took a job cutting meat for $12 an hour and saved over $10,000 in one year and went to university. He accused me of thinking I was better than him (he barely passed high school and has no post secondary) and refused to give me a single penny to help. He makes over $100,000 a year and had no debt and no mortgage(at the time, before my mom left him.)

I paid for my first three years of school in cash, working 20 hours a week while in school collecting my pharmacy prerequisites and I worked two full time jobs each summer to save up enough to pay tuition in cash. At one point I was $2000 in debt, working 30 hours a week, taking an extremely heavy course load, suffering from IBS and complications from that (non stop rectal bleeding) and still received no help.

He actively tried to sabotage me by providing me with no space to study at home, and emotionally, physically, and verbally abused me and my mother at home. I would be studying for finals and he would ask me to rewire the basement for him and go completely ballistic on me when I would say I dont have time but I'll gladly help after finals (apparently not dropping my studies to install a three way switch is disrespectful)

After my mother divorced him and moved out in September 2017 the abuse got even worse. I was getting my last 3 prerequisite classes to apply to pharmacy school and he would abuse me every day, sabotage me, watch me struggle to afford to feed myself and pay for gas to get to school and offer no help, etc. I am 23 and I have grown a lot of grey hair in the last three years from stress.

One night while I was playing xbox after writing a midterm he comes down and starts screaming in my face and going completely ballistic again for no reason, threatening to beat the shit out of me(he is a 6'2"" 250 pound hulk and I'm 5'9"" 200 pound man that is fairly muscular but nowhere near capable of defending myself from someone like him) and he would not stop threatening me and screaming in my face. I threatened to call the cops on him and he started freaking out even more so I drove away in the night and stayed at my maternal grandparents house overnight. I skipped school the next day and waited for him to go to work, came home with my grandpas SUV and loaded all of my belongings up and moved out. He has tried to contact me dozens of times now by sending random pictures of things, random messages like ""what's up"" but never any apologies or admittance of wrong-doing. I have not replied to any messages once. My last memory of him is backing out of my driveway calling him a piece of shit and disappearing in to the night.

I finished my last prerequisite in April and applied to pharmacy school, and this week I found out i was accepted. I have done this almost entirely on my own with absolutely zero support(my dad just refused and my mom just isnt capable since she doesnt make a lot of money) I am the first person in my family to ever go to university. I am 23 and have a butt load of grey hair from everything I had to go through. This is the most proud I have ever been of myself.

[Update 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/pharmacy/comments/8dq9xe/update_i_failed_my_very_last_rotation_before/)

Hi everyone. I am, at the moment, ECSTATIC about the result. I am graduating on time! 

Just to recap for everyone: I failed my last rotation (inpatient) rotation about 2 weeks ago, reasons being I was not ""clinically ready"". My preceptor was sure that I would not be a good pharmacist, so sure that she failed me on my last rotation - my Hail Marry pass to graduation. I appealed the grade to the school board. Their decision: to send me on another 2 weeks ""rotation"" and get a different opinion on my clinical knowledge. 

So the remediation rotation started last Tuesday, and I was informed that it would last 2 weeks. Today is Tuesday, exactly 1 week after I started, and they informed me that I have demonstrated enough of my skills, and that they would pass me and I would no longer need to complete an extra week. 

I don't know what to say. I don't know what to think. I am just extremely happy. I can't thank everyone enough for the support. I am just immensely relieved that I was given a second chance and I did not let it go to waste. So THANK YOU! 

Now to the million dollar question: why did I fail in the first place? Honestly? I don't know. My gut feelings say my past preceptor just had it out for me and she would fail me no matter what I did. But why did she decide to do that to me, and not to every of her student, I truly don't know. I'm not sure if I want to find out. On one hand, I can't wait to put this stressful experience behind me and go about with the rest of my life. On the other hand, I would like to at least know why some people decided against me - possibly due to my personality? Something that I said or did? I don't know. I was never a terrible student in school, and I didn't have any problem with most of my rotation. So why put me through this nightmare? I can't for the life of me figure out. I guess I will never know. But ... to new beginnings, yeah? :)
